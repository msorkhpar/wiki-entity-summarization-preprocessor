'''''Chorthippus lacustris''','' the '''Epirus dancing grasshopper''', is a species of [[grasshopper]] belonging to the genus ''[[Chorthippus]]''. This species is native to northwest [[Greece]] and is critically endangered. The Epirus dancing grasshopper is a part of the [[animal]] kingdom and the [[Arthropod|arthropod]] phylum. 

==Habitat==

This species lives in wet temporary [[Grassland|grasslands]] and needs high soil humidity.<ref>https://www.speciesconservation.org/case-studies-projects/epirus-grasshopper/11678</ref> The Epirus dancing grasshopper's habitat is currently threatened mainly by the urbanization of northwest Greece.<ref>https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/14870997/70432562</ref> Only five populations of this species remain in the world.  

==Conservation==

The Epirus dancing grasshopper is currently listed as [[Critically Endangered|critically endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List|IUCN red list]] and is on the verge of extinction. There are five remnant known populations. [[Deforestation]] and urbanization has caused this species to create [[habitat fragmentation]] which makes it difficult for separate populations too reproduce with each other.<ref>https://www.grasshoppersofeurope.com/linnaeus_ng/app/views/species/nsr_taxon.php?id=1073&cat=CTAB_NAMES</ref> These species are particularly vulnerable to [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]] due to their narrow ecological niche. Drainage, intensive cattle grazing and land conversion to agricultural fields are other threats the Grasshopper faces.<ref>https://www.speciesconservation.org/case-studies-projects/epirus-grasshopper/11678</ref><ref>https://www.speciesconservation.org/case-studies-projects/epirus-grasshopper/11678 No conservation efforts are currently being made to protect these species.</ref>

The '''155 Battery''' of the [[172nd Field Regiment, Royal Artillery|172nd Field Regiment]], Royal Artillery was an artillery unit during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The unit was one of three [[Artillery battery|artillery batteries]] that formed part of the 172nd Field Regiment, the others being batteries 153 and 154.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Battle of Sidi Nsir, Tunisia |url=https://www.royalhampshireregiment.org/about-the-museum/timeline/battle-sidi-nsir-tunisia-26th-february-1943/ |access-date=2023-03-31 |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment Museum |language=en-GB}}</ref>.

== Founding ==
After [[Operation Dynamo]] came to an end in 1940, the decision was made to place artillery batteries along the British coast to protect the [[United Kingdom]] against a German invasion<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery {{!}} WorldCat.org |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/21298417 |access-date=2023-03-31 |website=www.worldcat.org |language=en}}</ref>.

By 1942 the need to protect Britain's coastline with Artillery had diminished. At the same time the Royal Artillery was in need of additional [[Field artillery|field artillery.]] To meet this need, the 3rd Defense Regiment was converted into the 172nd Field Regiment. In August the regiment was transferred to the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|British 1st Army]] to take part in [[Operation Torch]]. On January 1, 1943, the troops of the 172nd field regiment were divided into 3 batteries: battery 153, 54 and 155<ref>{{Cite web |title=The war on land, 1939-1945 : an anthology of personal experience {{!}} WorldCat.org |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/1004975868 |access-date=2023-03-31 |website=www.worldcat.org |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Battery Finder - Batteries 150 - 299 |url=https://ra39-45.co.uk/battery-finder/battery-finder-batteries-150-299 |access-date=2023-03-31 |website=The Royal Artillery 1939-45 |language=en-GB}}</ref>.

In 1943, the 172nd field regiment was sent to North Africa. During the crossing of the Mediterranean, the ship carrying 155 battery was hit by a torpedo from a German U-boat, all weapons were lost, but the majority of the troops survived. Arriving in Tunisia, 155 battery was tasked with guarding a place called “Hunts Gap” in Sidi Nsir, just north of Beja. 155 battery was armed with 8 25-pounders and consisted of about 200 men<ref name="":0"">{{Cite web |title=Field Regiment Royal Artillery {{!}} Researching the Lives and Records of WW2 Soldiers |url=http://www.researchingww2.co.uk/field-regiment-royal-artillery/ |access-date=2023-03-31 |website=www.researchingww2.co.uk}}</ref>.

[[Operation Ochsenkopf]] began on February 26. This was an Axis operation in which several targets were attacked at the same time. One of the attacks was an attack on Sidi Nsir where 155 battery was stationed. Sidi Nsir was defended by 155 Battery with support from the [[Royal Hampshire Regiment|5th battalion of the Hampsire Regiment]], about 500 men in total. The German attackers had about 13,000 infantry and 77 tanks at their disposal<ref name="":0"" />.

In the early morning German mortars began to fall on the guns of 155 battery. After the mortar attack the Germans attacked with tanks, the tanks drove towards 155 battery via a road called Mateur. One of the 25-pounders of 155 battery was able to fire over open sights at this tank column, so the tanks had to swerve and they got stuck in a minefield. The tanks suffered damage and had to retreat.

Around 11 o'clock the Germans attempted another attack, this time from the left flank. Part of 155 battery noticed the attack and managed to knock out four tanks, after which the Germans had to break off the attack again. Around noon the Germans were again preparing for an attack, but this was called off<ref name="":1"">{{Cite web |title=The bloody road to Tunis : destruction of the Axis forces in North Africa, November 1942-May 1943 {{!}} WorldCat.org |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/45394318 |access-date=2023-03-31 |website=www.worldcat.org |language=en}}</ref>.

At 13 o'clock another attack by the Germans began. The Germans attacked from two sides with about 30 tanks and infantry. The observation post that was supposed to control the artillery was overrun and the telephone lines were destroyed. The battery was attacked from the air by [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters, these attacks caused fire in the ammunition trucks, which made it difficult to resupply the guns<ref name="":1"" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=The war on land, 1939-1945 : an anthology of personal experience {{!}} WorldCat.org |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/1004975868 |access-date=2023-03-31 |website=www.worldcat.org |language=en}}</ref><ref name="":2"">{{Cite journal |date=July 9, 1943 |title=The War illustrated |journal= |volume=7 |issue=158 |pages=77}}</ref>

At 15:00 the Germans attacked with a column of tanks led by a [[Tiger I|Tiger]] supported by infantry, while other tanks fired from a distance. The first three tanks were hit, forcing the German troops to withdraw and fire on the battery from a distance. By 5:30 p.m., all but one of the 25-pounders had been knocked out. Towards evening the Germans attacked for the last time, the only remaining gun continuing to fire until the enemy tanks were within 30 yards.<ref name="":2"" /><ref name="":3"">{{Cite web |title=The Glorious 155th Battery Fought to the End - The War Illustrated - TracesOfWar.com |url=https://www.tracesofwar.com/thewarillustrated/158/the-glorious-155th-battery-fought-to-the-end.asp?c=twi |access-date=2023-03-31 |website=www.tracesofwar.com}}</ref>. The German tanks drove over the positions of 155 battery crushing the guns and soldiers, the last message the battery sent was ""Tanks are on us"" and a V in [[Morse code]]<ref name="":2"" />

Of the 130 men (9 officers and 121 men of other ranks) of 155 battery, only 9 managed to get to safety.

=== Consequences ===
The battle in Sidi was a heavy loss for the British, but the heavy resistance of 155 battery gave other troops time to prepare for the attack, partly because of this the Axis powers failed to reach the objectives of Operation Ochsenkopf.

73484608,Generalized_balanced_ternary,"'''Generalized balanced ternary''' is a generalization of the [[balanced ternary]] [[numeral system]] to represent points in a higher-dimensional [[Euclidean space |space]].  It was first described in 1982 by Laurie Gibson and Dean Lucas<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gibson |first1=Laurie |last2=Lucas |first2=Dean |title=Spatial Data Processing Using Generalized Balanced Ternary |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Pattern Recognition and Image Processing |date=1982 |pages=566–571}}</ref>.  It has since been used for various applications, including geospatial<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sahr |first1=Kevin |title=Hexagonal Discrete Global Grid Systems for Geospatial Computing|journal=Archives of Photogrammetry, Cartography and Remote Sensing |date=2011-01-01 |volume=22 |url=http://webpages.sou.edu/~sahrk/sqspc/pubs/sahrMMT11us.pdf}}</ref> and high-performance scientific<ref>{{cite journal |last1=de Kinder |first1=R. E., Jr. |last2=Barnes |first2=J. R. |title=The Generalized Balanced Ternary (GBT) Applied to High-Performance Computational Algorithms |journal=APS Meeting Abstracts |date=August 1997}}</ref> computing.

== General form ==

Like standard [[positional numeral system]]s, generalized balanced ternary represents a point <math>p</math> as powers of a '''base''' <math>B</math> multiplied by '''digits''' <math>d_i</math>.

<math display=""block"">p = d_0 + B d_1 + B^2 d_2 + \ldots</math>

Generalized balanced ternary uses a [[transformation matrix]] as its base <math>B</math>.  Digits are [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] chosen from a finite subset <math>\{D_0 = 0, D_1, \ldots, D_n\}</math> of the underlying space.

== One dimension ==

In one dimension, generalized balanced ternary is equivalent to standard balanced ternary, with three digits (0, 1, and -1).  <math>B</math> is a <math>1\times 1</math> matrix, and the digits <math>D_i</math> are length-1 vectors, so they appear here without the extra brackets.

<math display=""block"">\begin{align}B &= 3 \\ D_0 &= 0 \\ D_1 &= 1 \\ D_2 &= -1\end{align}</math>

=== Addition table ===

This is the same addition table as standard balanced ternary, but with <math>D_2</math> replacing T.  To make the table easier to read, the numeral <math>i</math> is written instead of <math>D_i</math>.

 :{| class=""wikitable"" style=""width: 8em; text-align: center;""

 | 0 || 1 || 2
 |-
 ! 1 
 | 1 || 12 || 0
 |-
 ! 2 
 | 2 || 0 || 21
 |}

== Two dimensions ==

In two dimensions, there are seven digits.  The digits <math>D_1, \ldots, D_6</math> are six points arranged in a regular hexagon centered at <math>D_0 = 0</math>.<ref name=""van Roessel"">{{cite journal |last1=van Roessel |first1=Jan W. |title=Conversion of Cartesian coordinates from and to Generalized Balanced Ternary addresses |journal=Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing |date=1988 |volume=54 |pages=1565–1570 |url=https://www.asprs.org/wp-content/uploads/pers/1988journal/nov/1988_nov_1565-1570.pdf}}</ref>

<math display=""block"">
\begin{align}
B &= \frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix} 5 & \sqrt{3} \\ -\sqrt{3} & 5 \end{bmatrix} \\
D_0 &= 0 \\
D_1 &= \left( 0, \sqrt{3} \right) \\
D_2 &= \left( \frac{3}{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) \\
D_3 &= \left( \frac{3}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) \\

D_5 &= \left( -\frac{3}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) \\
D_6 &= \left( 0, -\sqrt{3} \right) \\
\end{align}
</math>

=== Addition table ===

As in the one-dimensional addition table, the numeral <math>i</math> is written instead of <math>D_i</math> (despite e.g. <math>D_2</math> having no particular relationship to the number 2).

 :{| class=""wikitable"" style=""width: 8em; text-align: center;""

 |-
 ! 6

 |}

If there are two numerals in a cell, the left one is carried over to the next digit.  Unlike standard addition, addition of two-dimensional generalized balanced ternary numbers may require multiple carries to be performed while computing a single digit.<ref name=""van Roessel"" />

'''[[Høng]] [[Bookselling|Boghandel]]''', was an independent Danish book retailer established in 1883. The bookstore has a long and rich history, given its long-standing family ownership and the emotional attachment that people had to the store. <ref>{{Cite web |last=sn.dk |date=2008-12-08 |title=Dødsfald |url=https://www.sn.dk/danmark/doedsfald-191/ |access-date=2023-04-10 |website=Sjællandske Nyheder |language=da-DK}}</ref>

== History and developments ==
The independent bookstore, was originally founded by Johannes Sørensen on November 11, 1912. In 1916, it was taken over by Sven Thorbek, who moved the store from Hovedgaden no. 15 to no. 33 in 1922. Sven Thorbek passed away in 1947, and his wife, Kirsten Thorbek, took over and ran the business.

In 1962, their son Mogens Thorbek became the owner of the bookstore. The bookstore celebrated its 60th anniversary on November 1, 1977. However, on December 5, 1983, after being owned by the Thorbek family for 67 years, the bookstore was taken over by a limited company, and Johannes. Helweg became the professional leader. 

John Petersen became the professional manager on January 1, 1985, and on November 1, 1986, the bookstore welcomed a new academic manager, Grethe Bukrinsky. However, in 1989, the store went into receivership on October 31st. 

On March 1, 1990, the business was assumed as a cash bookshop and Mogens Thorbek returned as the manager. He was over 70 years old at the time. On June 21, 1990, Birgitte Nielsen became the technical manager. Lykke Bjørn Rasmussen returned as the professional manager on February 1, 1991. 

Liselotte Hansen became the academic manager in 1999. Despite its long and storied history, the independent bookstore unfortunately closed its doors on June 30, 2011, marking the end of an era for the community it served. Its closure is a reminder of the challenges faced by independent bookstores in the modern era, as they compete with larger chains and online retailers. <ref>{{Cite web |title=Boghandlere i Danmark - Høng Bog- og Papirhandel |url=http://www.boghandlereidanmark.dk/index.php?id=967&beskrivelsesnummer=1326&p_mode=beskrivelse&cHash=572d1ee6a65164e6b6158956a566c4ae |access-date=2023-04-10 |website=www.boghandlereidanmark.dk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2011-05-24 |title=Ejer: - Det er vemodigt at skulle lukke |url=https://www.sn.dk/kalundborg-kommune/ejer-det-er-vemodigt-at-skulle-lukke/ |access-date=2023-04-10 |website=Sjællandske Nyheder |language=da-DK}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Røveri mod boghandel |url=https://www.tv2east.dk/kalundborg/roveri-mod-boghandel |access-date=2023-04-10 |website=TV2 ØST |language=da}}</ref>

=== Historical interest ===

The old bookstore that was founded in 1912 by Johannes Sørensen and later taken over by Sven Thorbek in 1916, has historical interest due to its rich and long history. The fact that the store was operated by the same family for 67 years, from 1916 until 1983, is remarkable and speaks to the dedication and commitment of the Thorbek family to their business. The bookstore's importance is also evident in the various transitions it went through, such as its move to a new location in 1922, and the change of ownership in 1983. The fact that the store was able to survive the economic challenges that led to receivership in 1989 is also notable, as it speaks to the resilience and tenacity of the management and staff.

Furthermore, the bookstore's significance is demonstrated in the various individuals who assumed management positions over the years. The fact that Mogens Thorbek, the son of Sven Thorbek, returned to manage the store in 1990 when he was over 70 years old, highlights the emotional and sentimental attachment that people had to the bookstore.

Overall, this independent bookstore's rich history, long-standing family ownership, and the numerous transitions it went through over the years make it an important and historically significant institution. Its closing in 2011 marks the end of an era for the community it served, and a reminder of the changing landscape of independent bookstores in the modern era. <ref>{{Cite web |last=Nørregaard |first=Allan |date=2011-05-21 |title=Boghandel lukker |url=https://www.sn.dk/kalundborg-kommune/boghandel-lukker/ |access-date=2023-04-10 |website=Sjællandske Nyheder |language=da-DK}}</ref>

== Thorbeks family history ==

=== Sven Thorbek & Kirsten Svendsen ===
Sven Thorbek (born 9.12.1885-1947) in Odense, son of headmaster Kristian Sørensen Thorbek (born March 15, 1853) and Kristine Nielsen (born July 31, 1853). He was an apprentice at Edv. G. Hansen in Odense and worked as an assistant at Axel Andersen and Axel E. Aamodt, both in Copenhagen, as well as at Chr. G. Kielberg in Svendborg and C. Ferslew & Co. in Copenhagen. He spent a couple of years away from the bookstore, but returned to work as an assistant at J. Gjellerup in 1914-15 and E. Henningsen in Holbæk in 1915-16 before taking over the bookstore in Høng. He married Kirsten Vilhelmine Svendsen (born March 21, 1887) on October 24, 1918. She was born in Køge, daughter of butcher Henrik Gustav Svendsen (born June 14, 1862) and Karen Sofie Nielsen (born October 22, 1864). After her husband's death, she ran the business for 15 years until 1962, when their son Mogens Thorbek took over (source: Dolleris IV etc.). <ref>{{Cite web |title=Boghandlere i Danmark - Thorbek, Sven |url=http://www.boghandlereidanmark.dk/index.php?id=967&medarbejdernummer=2539&p_mode=medarbejder&cHash=0be7e490f614b6a4d143c9346057952f |access-date=2023-04-10 |website=www.boghandlereidanmark.dk}}</ref>

=== Mogens Thorbek & Inger Thorbek ===
Mogens Thorbek (born June 19, 1919) Son of bookdealer Sven Thorbek (December 9, 1885 - 1947) and Kirsten Vilhelmine Svendsen (born March 21, 1887) in Høng. He apprenticed in Ringsted and Rønne from 1939-41, then worked as an assistant in Tønder, Åbybro, Silkeborg, and Hillerød. He took over the family bookstore in Høng from his mother in 1962<ref>{{Cite web |title=arkiv.dk {{!}} Thorbek, Mogens |url=https://arkiv.dk/vis/42375 |access-date=2023-04-10 |website=arkiv.dk}}</ref>. In 1983, the business was turned into a limited company with various professional leaders: Johs. Helweg, John Petersen, Grethe Bukrinsky, and Lykke Bjørn Rasmussen. However, in 1989, the bookstore went into receivership. Mogens Thorbek, now 70 years old, took over once again, and the bookstore operated as a cash bookstore for a few years before getting back on its feet.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Boghandlere i Danmark - Thorbek, Sven |url=http://www.boghandlereidanmark.dk/index.php?id=967&medarbejdernummer=2539&p_mode=medarbejder&cHash=0be7e490f614b6a4d143c9346057952f |access-date=2023-04-10 |website=www.boghandlereidanmark.dk}}</ref>

== Artistic production ==
His pictorial theme for over thirty years was the culture and peasant tradition of [[Abruzzo]], where Lamento's attachment to his own land appears evident; an ancient world that is disappearing and recognizes the painful existence of a life that can only find existential solutions in deep contact with nature. In these works, there is a yearning nostalgia for a world that is disappearing due to the incivility of this modernity.<ref>{{Cite web |title=NOTA CRITICA |url=https://gaetanominaleartistapittore.jimdofree.com/nota-critica/ |access-date=2023-04-15 |website=Benvenuti su gaetanominaleartistapittore! |language=it-IT}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=OPERE |url=https://gaetanominaleartistapittore.jimdofree.com/opere/ |access-date=2023-04-15 |website=Benvenuti su gaetanominaleartistapittore! |language=it-IT}}</ref>

In 2011 - The woman becomes the true protagonist of his painting in symbiosis with nature; the large canvases are born where you can see long landscapes of immense expanses of poppies, sunflowers and daisies where the light enters the wide and flowery meadows and spreads their brightness. Yellow brooms at the foot of the Majella and the spectacular overflows along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast of the Chieti area testifying to the ancient fishing on stilts with a net, and then the figures and faces of women immersed in the green flowery meadows which, even if motionless, speak of life.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ARTINWORLD.COM - GAETANO MINALE {{!}}{{!}} Pittori |url=https://www.artinworld.com/Artista.aspx?ID=0001AG&AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |access-date=2023-04-15 |website=www.artinworld.com}}</ref>

The '''Diamondbacks-Rockies rivalry''' is a [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) [[National League]] divisional [[Major League Baseball rivalries|rivalry]] played between the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] and the [[Colorado Rockies]].

==History==
Colorado initially joined the MLB during the 1993 expansion, being relegated to the National League West. On March 9, 1995, the MLB granted two new teams for the 1998 season: The Arizona Diamondbacks and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The Diamondbacks' first major league game was played against the [[Colorado Rockies]] on March 31, [[1998 Arizona Diamondbacks season|1998]], at Bank One Ballpark. Fairly soon; animosity was starting to surface as multiple players and staff on the Rockies accused Diamondbacks' manager [[Buck Showalter]] of stealing signs during spring training in 1998. During a 1999 game in Denver, Showalter engaged into a verbal altercation with Rockies' owner [[Dick Monfort]] partially due to the accusations. Showalter was restrained by stadium security as he was escorted to the Diamondbacks' locker room following the game. Both teams began to rebuild into formidable contenders through the latter half of the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2007/10/08/rockies-diamondbacks-rivalry-on-deck/|title=Rockies-Diamondbacks rivalry on deck?}}</ref> 

The 2007 season saw the Diamondbacks win the NL West by half a game ahead of the Rockies, however; Colorado still managed to enter the postseason as a Wild Card team. The Rockies managed an improbable sweep of the Phillies in the NLDS, and were set to face the Diamondbacks in the NLCS. The Rockies managed to beat Arizona in a convincing sweep, with sportswriters and fans in shock of the bizarre playoff push by the Rockies, The Rockies run in 2007 was nicknamed “'''Rocktober'''” — a portmanteau of the Rockies team name and October.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Saunders|first=Patrick|date=2012-10-23|title=Rocktober: When the Rockies accomplished the impossible in 2007|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2012/10/23/rocktober-when-the-rockies-accomplished-the-impossible-in-2007/|access-date=2020-12-22|website=The Denver Post|language=en-US}}</ref> Despite the two sweeps during the 2007 postseason push, the Rockies themselves would fall in a sweep by the Boston Red Sox during the World Series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eastvalleytribune.com/sports/2007-nlcs-just-start-of-d-backs-rockies-rivalry/article_d72844bb-9966-5dff-a2b5-b4886dd0fb6c.html|title=2007 NLCS just start of D-Backs-Rockies rivalry?}}</ref>

[[File:Colorado Rockies (25269130420).jpg|thumb|right|The Rockies play the Diamondbacks during a Spring Training game in 2016]]
Both teams would begin to wane in competition following the matchup, 2007 marks the final time to date, either the Rockies or Diamondbacks would appear in the NLCS. The Rockies would make one playoff appearance in 2009, while the Diamondbacks would make an appearance in the NLDS in 2011. Both teams began to rebuild as runner-ups of the division, and would meet again during the 2017 Wild Card Game. The Dodgers had run away with the division, Arizona still managed to win 93 games and finish as divisional runner-ups, meanwhile the Rockies finished 6 games behind Arizona and snagged the second lowest remaining wild card berth due to the St. Louis Cardinals falling in their final two of three games to end the season.
This was Arizona's first postseason appearance since the [[2011 National League Division Series]]. This was Colorado's first postseason appearance since the [[2009 National League Division Series]]. [[Jon Gray]] started for the Rockies,<ref>{{cite web|last=Saunders |first=Patrick |url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/10/03/rockies-confident-jon-gray-vs-diamondbacks/ |title=Rockies confident Jon Gray can take playoff step vs. Diamondbacks – The Denver Post |publisher=Denverpost.com |date=September 7, 2017 |access-date=October 5, 2017}}</ref> and [[Zack Greinke]] started for the Diamondbacks.<ref>{{cite web|last=Saunders |first=Patrick |url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/10/03/rockies-against-d-backs-zack-greinke/ |title=Rockies know they're up against a true ace in D-backs' Zack Greinke – The Denver Post |date=October 4, 2017 |publisher=Denverpost.com |access-date=October 5, 2017}}</ref> Despite the Diamondbacks taking an early lead, Colorado managed 4 runs in the fourth inning to rally and attempt a comeback, but Arizona's runs in the seventh and eighth innings all but sealed the victory for the Diamondbacks.

== Facts ==
At the age of 31, Wendy Thompson consulted her GP, the defendant, Doctor Christine Arnold, about a lump on her left breast which was diagnosed by the defendant as benign, when it was not. By the time it became apparent that the diagnosis had been negligently made, it was too late to save Mrs Thompson's life. In all probability, she may not have died if the correct diagnosis had been made.<ref name="":0"" />  

At the point she became aware that a cause of action was possible against her former doctor, she was already terminally ill, however, she managed to serve proceedings against her former doctor by September 1999. It was predicted that she would die of cancer at some point within the next year. Her lifetime action was settled for the sum of £120,000 in ""full and final satisfaction of her claim"", however, she had first obtained judgment in default of defence because liability was not in question at that stage.<ref name="":1"">{{Cite news |author=<!--not stated--> |date=2007-11-23 |title=No duty on doctor's solicitor to inform opponent of mistake |url=https://www.imt.ie/news/no-duty-on-doctors-solicitor-to-inform-opponent-of-mistake-23-11-2007/ |access-date=2023-04-29 |url-access=subscription |work=[[Irish Medical Times]] |language=en |location= |quote=...Mrs Thompson first obtained judgment in default of a defence being lodged and then proceeded to settle her action.

The schedule of loss and damage described in the particulars of claim of September 1999 contained a statement that after her death, her dependants would be able to issue a separate claim pursuant to the Fatal Accidents Act 1976. However, her legal representatives appeared to have been unaware that a Fatal Accidents Act claim could not be brought by dependants in the situation where the deceased had already been awarded damages. 

Wendy Thompson died on 10 April 2002. Three years later her husband and two daughters issued a claim against Dr Arnold under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976.<ref name="":0"" /> When the case came before the High Court on 7 April 2005, the defence sought direction on the preliminary issue that the action could not be brought since the damages claim of the deceased had been settled during her lifetime.<ref name="":1"" />

It was held that the dependants of an accident victim who had already received a compensation award for personal injury which later prove fatal were unable to make a claim under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976.<ref name="":2"" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Thompson & Ors v Arnold [2007] EWHC 1875 (QB) (06 August 2007) |url=https://www.casecheck.co.uk/thompson-ors-v-arnold-2007-ewhc-1875-qb-06-august-2007.html |access-date=2023-04-30 |website=www.casecheck.co.uk}}</ref> More specifically, an action under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 cannot be brought where there has been full and final settlement of a claim made under The Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934, also known as a LR(MP)A claim.<ref name="":3"">{{Cite web |last=Beeby |first=Gabriel |title=An Overview of Claims for and Following Death |url=https://www.guildhallchambers.co.uk/pdfs/guildhall-1590.pdf |access-date=24 April 2023 |website=guildhallchambers.co.uk |format=PDF}}</ref>

=== Mistake and duty ===
At an early stage, prior to pleadings being issued, a mistake of law had been made by the head of the solicitor and counsel for the claimant.<ref name="":0"" /> The mistake was that the legal representatives appeared to be unaware that a claim under the Fatal Accidents Act could not be brought where the deceased had already been awarded, or had agreed, damages for their injury. This had the effect of the damages claim being erroneously and deliberately overvalued.<ref name="":6"">{{Cite web |last=Whiteley |first=Miranda |date=2007-09-30 |title=Mistake |url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a196ef12-cd2c-41d5-be55-d1af9019d9cd |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=Mills & Reeve LLP |language=en |via=Lexology |quote=In Thompson, the claimant’s solicitor had submitted a deliberately over-inflated claim.}}</ref> The claim which had been settled for £120,000 did not include an amount for future loss of earnings, or rather, the “lost years”. The defendant's solicitor did not inform the claimant's legal advisors of the mistake because she believed, ""consistent with her professional duty to her client"", that she should not point out the mistake to the opponent.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":6"" /> 

When proceedings were brought, the mistake of law by the late Mrs Thompson’s solicitor and counsel was admitted candidly to the court. However, this mistake had been taken advantage of by the defendant in the original case.<ref name="":1"" /> This amounted to a unilateral mistake, rather than mutual mistake.<ref>{{Cite web |date=6 August 2007 |title=Thompson v Arnold |url=https://vlex.co.uk/vid/thompson-v-arnold-793279653 |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=vlex.co.uk |at=14 |language=en |quote=The mistake was thus unilateral, not mutual.

=== Limitation ===
Any action to recover damages in respect of the injury due to Dr Arnold's negligence was precluded from the point Wendy Thompson settled her claim.

<blockquote>""a right of children and spouses to claim an award for loss of their dependency upon the deceased wife and mother arises where there has been no determination (by settlement or judgment) of the claim of the injured victim prior to her death.""<ref>{{cite BAILII|litigants=Thompson & Ors v Arnold|link=|court=EWHC|division=QB|year=2007|num=1875|para=90|parallelcite=|date=6 August 2007|courtname=|juris=|ref=}}</ref></blockquote>

''Yekl: A Tale of the New York Ghetto'' is [[Abraham Cahan|Abraham Cahan’s]] first book and was published in 1896. It depicts the life of Jewish immigrants living in a [[New York City]] [[ghetto]]. The plot follows Yekl, Russian-Jewish immigrant [[sweatshop]] worker, as he attempts to [[Jewish assimilation|assimilate]] into American culture. His attempts are complicated by the arrival of his wife and son, which force him to decide between his Jewish identity and a new American one. 

The [[novella]] uses an interesting blend of [[Literary realism|realism]] and [[American literary regionalism|regionalism]] to depict what life was like for newly arrived immigrants in the United States. Realism author [[William Dean Howells]] played a large part in getting the story published, as he discovered and encouraged Cahan to write a more serious story about life in the Jewish ghetto.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44426733 |title=Jewish American literature: A Norton Anthology |date=2001 |publisher=W.

== Plot Summary ==
The story starts with Jake, three years after he first stepped foot in America. In that time, he has embraced American culture as much as possible, so much so that he no longer goes by his given name, Yekl. When he’s not working in the sweatshop, he spends much of his time at Joe Peltner’s dance hall, where he becomes close with Mamie and Fanny. 

One day, he receives a letter from home informing him of his father’s death. While he has enjoyed his time pretending to be a bachelor, the news prompts him to make good on his promise to buy a ticket for his wife (Gitl) and son (Yossele) to join him in New York.

Upon their arrival, Jake is embarrassed by his wife’s appearance and ignorance of the English language. He tries to correct this behavior and even gets Mrs. Kavarsky (his neighbor) to help turn Gitl into a more American woman. Gitl tries, but struggles to throw away her traditional beliefs and customs. 

Mamie, one of Jake's dance partners, then pays a visit to Jake and he starts to fall for her. Mamie, unlike Gitl, has changed herself to become a proper American woman, at least in the context of the Jewish ghetto they inhabit. Jake pays her a visit, which Fanny (one of Jake's dance partners and coworkers) witnesses and reports back to Gitl. 

Gitl runs to Mrs. Kavarsky with the news and Mrs. Kavarsky removes Gitl’s handkerchief from her head and cuts her hair in order to make her more appealing to Jake. However, this is not enough for Jake, so he leaves and runs to Mamie. Finding her, he declares his love and they conceive a plan to get him and Gitl a divorce, so the two can get married. 

The divorce gets finalized, allowing Gitl to marry Mr. Bernstein (their neighbor and Jake's coworker) and Jake to marry Mamie. Jake then leaves with Mamie and they head to the mayor's office to get married. On their way, Jake begins to feel that he has made a mistake and wishes that he didn’t have to get married again.<ref name="":1"">{{Cite book |last=Cahan |first=Abraham |title=Yekl: A Tale of the New York Ghetto |publisher=D.

== Characters ==

* Yekl (Jake) Podkovnik – a Jewish immigrant from Russia who works in a sweatshop. He loves to dance and embraces American culture, choosing to go by Jake and using English phrases as much as he can. He struggles when faced with his past life in Russia, which he ultimately abandons in favor of living an American lifestyle. 
* Gitl Podkovnik – Yekl’s wife, who moves to New York City three years after Yekl arrives. She has a major culture shock on arrival, but is reluctant to change.  
* Yossele Podkovinik – Yekl and Gitl’s young son.
* Mamie – A Polish immigrant, who is one of Yekl’s dance partners that he eventually falls for because she represents the ideal, assimilated woman. 
* Fanny – Yekl’s coworker, who likes Yekl until she finds out he’s married and tells Gitl about Yekl’s inappropriate behavior with Mamie.
* Mrs. Kavarsky – an older lady, who tries to help Gitl become more American so that Yekl will love her again.
* Mr. Bernstein – a well read coworker of Yekl’s, who marries Gitl when Yekl leaves her for Mamie.
* Joe Peltner – owner of the dance hall Yekl spends much of his time at.<ref name="":1"" />
== Themes ==

=== Immigration and Assimilation ===
This story is ultimately about immigrants, immigration, and assimilation. The narrative takes place in the New York ghetto and there is not a single ""American"" character present. Jake's (Yekl's) desire for assimilation clear from the very beginning of the novella. He has Americanized his name to Jake, he talks about American sports, and seems overall uninterested in practicing his Jewish faith. While he tries to push his old Russian life behind him, the arrival of his wife and son prevent that. Gitl, unlike Jake, is unwilling to throw away her [[Old World]] morals and behavior for the sake of being an American. These two characters go down to completely different paths at the end of the novel, leaving Gitl happy with a man who respects the Old World as she does and Jake with dreading the future he chose.<ref name="":1"" />

=== Language ===
All of the dialogue in ''Yekl'' is a mix of English translated [[Yiddish]] and [[English language|English]] spoken with a Yiddish accent. By exposing readers to Yiddish, Cahan more concretely roots the story in the Jewish [[ghetto]] its set it. In many ways, the inclusion of this type of language helps preserve the culture existing at the time, which is what characterizes ''Yekl'' as an example of [[Regionalism (literature)|regionalism]].

Within the narrative, language plays a critical role. Jake (Yekl) uses it to show how much he has embraced American culture, by using English words as much as possible. He also uses his knowledge of the English language to both impress and ridicule Gitl for his knowledge and her ignorance. Mamie is another character who knows English quite well, which is a sign of her Americanization. Additionally, Mamie uses English to alienate Gitl during their first meeting.<ref name="":1"" /> In many ways, knowledge of English operates as a symbol of power in this story. 

=== Masculinity ===
Throughout the novella Jake (Yekl) repeats the phrase ""Dot'sh a' kin' a man ''I'' am!,"" however, it's never clear what kind of man he actually is. Jake presents himself as a bachelor before his wife and son's arrival to New York and then can't seem to decide if he has enough love to stay with them or not. In the end, he decides to leave them for the Americanized Mamie and finds himself dreading that decision.<ref name="":1"" /> Given the contrast between Jake's declaration and his actions, Cahan seems to imply that Jake's presentation of masculinity is far different from his understanding of it. Literary critic Clay Motley explains that ""Jake defines American manhood in terms of intense personal freedom, aggression, materialism, and success in attracting many different women.""<ref name="":3"">{{Cite journal |last=Motley |first=Clay |date=2011 |title=“Dot’ sh a’ Kin’ a man I am!”: Abraham Cahan, Masculinity, and Jewish Assimilation in Nineteenth-Century America. |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/27854 |journal=Studies in American Jewish Literature |volume=30 |pages=3-15 |via=Project MUSE}}</ref> This is supported by Jake changing his name from Yekl, creating a new ""identity as an American man.""<ref name="":3"" /> As a result, Jake must overcompensate in order to conceal his Jewish identity as Yekl. The problem is, he will always be Yekl, which results in him making choices that are inconsistent with his internal morals.

=== Education ===
The issue of education is raised early on in the novella. Jake (Yekl) is an uneducated man, whose English is derived from his desire to become an American. Mr. Bernstein, on the other hand, spends his time reading newspapers with an English dictionary in order to get a proper understanding of the language. Literary critic Lori Jirousek-Falls describes Yekl's education style as ""incidental"" and Mr. Bernstein's as ""intentional.""<ref name="":4"">{{Cite journal |last=Jirousek-Falls |first=Lori |date=2007 |title=Abraham Cahan and Jewish Immigrant Education: For Men and Women |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41206068?sid=primo&seq=5 |journal=Studies in American Jewish Literature |volume=26 |pages=39-40 |via=JSTOR}}</ref> As a result, the two characters embark on different trajectories as the story develops. In the end, Mr. Bernstein and Gitl end up happily married, while Jake hopes that the ride to the court house will last indefinitely so he can remain a bachelor forever.<ref name="":1"" /> Jirousek-Falls concludes that ""Berstein represents the immigrant who prizes scholarship highly and discovers ways to incorporate Old World traditions with New World success,"" whereas Jake casts his Old World traditions aside, in favor of embracing American culture in an impulsive, unproductive way.<ref name="":4"" /> Both characters have authority over their choices, but it's clear that Cahan suggests that ""intentional"" education is more rewarding path.<ref name="":4"" />

== Publication and Critical Reception ==
After completing the manuscript, [[Abraham Cahan]] and [[William Dean Howells]] worked to find a publisher, which would be a difficult task.<ref name="":2"" /> Much of this was to do with the literary market of the time that had not fully embraced [[Literary realism|realism]] and poorly concealed [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] present in the publishing industry.<ref name="":2"" /> As a result, Cahan and Howells were rejected by a number of publishers including ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' and ''[[McClure's]]''.<ref name="":2"" /> Frustrated, Cahan decided to translate ''Yekl'' into [[Yiddish]] and published it in his own paper under the original title, ''Yankele the Yankee''.<ref name="":2"" /> Howells was initially upset learning about this, but considered that the book was not published because it wasn't in English.<ref name="":2"" /> Eventually, Howells would get the [[novella]] published with [[D. Appleton & Company|D. Appleton and Company]], where it would be published in 1896.<ref name="":2"" />

Despite finding a publisher and the glowing review Howells gave the novella, ''Yekl'' was not a commercial success.<ref name="":5"">{{Cite journal |last=Marovitz |first=Sanford E. |date=1969 |title=""YEKL:"" The Ghetto Realism of Abraham Cahan |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/27747662 |journal=American Literary Realism, 1870-1910 |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=271–273 |issn=0002-9823}}</ref> Literary realism was still growing as a genre and contemporary readers seemed to want ""their fiction to include beautiful people, attractive objects, and happy endings.""<ref name="":5"" /> As a result, some critics today feel that ''Yekl'' is a ""neglected masterpiece"", much like [[Kate Chopin]]'s ''[[The Awakening (Chopin novel)|The Awakening]]'', because of its examination of how dominant cultures impact minority groups; a problem that is still present in the United States.<ref name="":2"" />

'''Hokkaido''' is a level from [[IO Interactive]]'s ''[[Hitman (franchise)|Hitman]]'' video game franchise. It takes place in a fictional hospital in a remote location of Japan.

==Development==
Hokkaido was created by lead level designer Torbjørn Christensen. Christensen and lead game designer [[Jesper Hylling]] describe it as an absurd location due to how remote and inconvenient it is for people to get to it, but Christensen regarded that as a strength, owing to its ""fantastical"" nature that allows them to take more liberties than if it was set in [[Tokyo]].<ref name=""RPS""/> The developers had been looking for an opportunity to include a hospital in the ''Hitman'' series for a while, brainstorming on what could go wrong in a hospital setting.<ref name=""Interview""/> Initially, the setting was just going to be a hospital, but the team elected to add the resort and morgue in order to make it more surprising for players. They also sought to make the different parts of the level feel visually and thematically distinct. They went to lengths to ensure that the different areas felt like they made sense to be connected to one another, justifying the presence of a resort being that a rich patient would want to recuperate or the staff room having a [[dance mat]] game because it's set in Japan. When describing the level archetype Hokkaido fits into, Christensen called it a spiral, due to how they wrap around and interconnect with stairs and slopes.<ref name=""RPS"">{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-hitmans-hokkaido-level-was-made |title= How Hitman's Hokkaido level was made |work=[[Rock Paper Shotgun]] |last=Wiltshire |first=Alex |date=March 24, 2017 |accessdate=April 28, 2023}}</ref>

They set the location in Japan as part of their effort to have a hospital where the technology ""borders on science fiction."" They also chose it because they wanted to have a controlled climate setting located in a setting that's otherwise harsh. They also aimed to make the spa area inviting from a tourist point of view.<ref name=""Interview""/> The level is designed to be more restrictive than normal, requiring Agent 47 to be wearing certain disguises to get into certain areas. This is done by having an AI control the facility, and it only allows doors to open if Agent 47 is wearing a disguise that it deems fit to enter that area of the facility. The idea was that clothes were fitted with RFID chips that the AI would identify. This was a difficult thing to get working well, creating a number of issues for the team.<ref name=""RPS""/> They wanted to experiment with the idea of emphasizing the disguises after they experimented with a more military-focused level in [[Colorado (Hitman)|Colorado]].<ref name=""Interview""/> They had to avoid potentially confusing players, which they accomplished by having an early area require them to learn the gimmick, as well as through signposting the access levels on the doors and the clothing.<ref name=""RPS""/>

Hokkaido is a more dense level, which affects how the 300 non-playable character limit manifests. In other levels, areas that should be more densely populated than they are have justifications for why they aren't. Meanwhile, because the level is smaller, no such justification is necessary, and the level is busier as a result.<ref name=""RPS""/>

Art director Jonathan Rowe worked on the level, and found that Hokkaido being ""clean, stark, and austere"" made it more difficult to make the level look good. He felt that more details make something look more realistic, but due to how sterile the level was, it was difficult to make it not seem unfinished. Rowe accomplished this by focusing on ""micro details and surface details"" to complete the package.<ref name=""Vice"">{{cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/pgkvmn/how-hitman-uses-thoughtful-level-design-to-tell-stories |title=How 'Hitman' Uses Thoughtful Level Design to Tell Stories |work=[[Vice (website)|Vice]] |last=Wong |first=Kevin |date=December 2, 2016 |accessdate=April 28, 2023}}</ref> A surgical robot resembling a spider was featured in the level, and was based on car manufacturing robots. Rowe wanted something that was both ""industrial and clunky"" yet moved unnaturally fluidly, finding those two themes working in concert ""very disturbing.""<ref name=""Vice""/>

===Characters===
With Hokkaido, Christensen wanted to experiment with a static target to see if it would be interesting. This was attempted with the character Erich Soders, who is unconscious while undergoing gene therapy. Christensen wanted to take advantage of the spiral structure of the level as part of this target. He was partly designed in response to a mission in the [[Sapienza (Hitman)|Sapienza]] level, where Agent 47 has to eliminate a virus in an underground seaside cave. Christensen felt limited by this due to the fact that the virus had only few ways to be eliminated, and thus aimed to provide more in this case. This was accomplished by implementing failsafes designed to resuscitated Soders that need to be prevented.<ref name=""RPS""/> Soders was also chosen for this because of his role in the game, being that he had the power to determine whether Agent 47 would live or die. The designers put him in a helpless state in order to turn the tables in their roles.<ref name=""Interview"">{{cite web |url=https://www.gamereactor.fr/video/302683/Hitman+Season+1+Interview+Series+Chapter+6+Hokkaido/ |title=Hitman Season 1 Interview Series - Chapter 6: Hokkaido |work=Game Reactor |date=February 16, 2017 |accessdate=April 28, 2023}}</ref>

In 2005, Hyundai started manufacturing cars at a new [[Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama|plant in Alabama]]. Production is supported by a number of parts suppliers in Alabama, including SMART, which Hyundai owns. Other parts suppliers  involved in the scandal include SL, Hwashin, and {{Ill|AJIN|ko|아진산업}}.

Alabama also [[Compulsory education|requires children 17 and under to be enrolled in school]], which some of the underage workers had to forego in order to work long shifts at the plant.<ref name="":1"" /> Following the report, a California Hyundai owner filed a [[Class action|class action lawsuit]] against Hyundai claiming that ""Defendants materially omit and fail to disclose that Class Vehicles are manufactured using child labor"" and that Hyundai owners and lessees were harmed as a result.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Thornton |first=William |date=2022-08-01 |title=Hyundai Alabama child labor allegations lead to class action lawsuit |url=https://www.al.com/business/2022/08/hyundai-alabama-child-labor-allegations-lead-to-class-action-lawsuit.html |access-date=2022-08-14 |website=AL.com |language=en}}</ref>

On 29 September, 2022, the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]] fined SL Alabama, a division of Korean [[SL Corporation|SL Corp]], $30,076 for violating the [[Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938|Fair Labor Standards Act]]'s child labor provisions, following an inspection on 9 August, 2022. The [[consent decree]], ordered by the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama|U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama]], also prevents SL Alabama from shipping or delivering any goods produced using underage labor. It also requires training materials to be provided to employees and subcontractors to ensure compliance with child labor laws, quarterly trainings provided by a third party for three years, and sanctions on any management found responsible for violations. SL Alabama, which is based in [[Alexander City, Alabama|Alexander City]], supplied parts to Hyundai, as well as [[Kia]]. Separately, Alabama's state Department of Labor fined SL Alabama and JK USA Inc., its temporary labor recruiting firm, $17,800 each for a total of $35,600. Property records show that the house where some underage workers lived alongside other SL employees is owned by a company registered under the name of the president of the recruiting firm.<ref name="":3"" /> However, because the underage workers were at companies who only produced parts for Hyundai and Kia's supply chain, neither department of labor accused Hyundai or Kia of any wrongdoing.<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Federal court orders Hyundai, Kia auto parts manufacturer to stop employing minors illegally, end ‘oppressive’ child labor law violations |publisher=[[U.S. Department of Labor]] |date=October 11, 2022 |url=https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/WHD/WHD20221011 |access-date=April 27, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Rosenberg |first=Mica |last2=Schneyer |first2=Joshua |last3=Cooke |first3=Kristina |date=2022-10-11 |title=Hyundai, Kia auto parts supplier in Alabama fined for child labor violations |language=en |work=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/us/hyundai-kia-auto-parts-supplier-alabama-fined-child-labor-violations-2022-10-11/ |access-date=2023-04-27}}</ref>

Regulators were first tipped off about child labor in Hyundai's supply chain by a school official in 2021, who told them that a child around 12 years old was working at the Hwashin plant in [[Greenville, Alabama]]. After the Reuters investigation into SMART, Hwashin fired all their underage workers in fear of an inspection. Another parts supplier, {{Ill|AJIN|ko|아진산업}}, employed more than 10 underage workers according to several employees, including one manager who was told to ""focus on production"" after reporting the violations to his higher ups. At SMART, over 20 boys and girls aged around 12 to 16 worked around heavy equipment, including operating [[Forklift|forklifts]] and [[welding]]. After two incidents of teenage workers falling and injuring themselves, Carlos Herrera, an employee, said ""[he] would tell them: this person shouldn't be working... but they didn't care."" Herrera also alleges that Hyundai officials wearing Hyundai branded shirts visited the plant while children were working on the floor, saying that ""it was obvious there were minors."" Notes from the [[Office of Refugee Resettlement]] described how the underage workers experienced ""exploitation from [[debt bondage]] (repaying smuggling debts)"" and that ""some children expressed fear of [[deportation]] based on comments made by company officials to them.""<ref name="":3"">{{Cite news |last=Rosenberg |first=Mica |last2=Cooke |first2=Kristina |last3=Schneyer |first3=Joshua |date=December 16, 2022 |title=Child workers found throughout Hyundai-Kia supply chain in Alabama |language=en |work=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-immigration-hyundai/ |access-date=2023-04-27}}</ref>

On 22 November, 2022, inspectors from the state and federal departments of labor conducted a surprised inspection of a [[Hyundai Glovis]] warehouse in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. They found that a boy had been working at three different parts manufacturers from the age of 14, which resulted in the Alabama Department of Labor fining three separate staffing companies $5,050, which is the maximum state penalty for a child labor violation.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite news |last=Rosenberg |first=Mica |last2=Schneyer |first2=Joshua |last3=Cooke |first3=Kristina |date=2023-04-27 |title=Special Report: How a fake ID let Hyundai suppliers use child labor in Alabama |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/us/how-fake-id-repeatedly-enabled-hyundai-suppliers-employ-child-labor-alabama-2023-04-27/ |access-date=2023-04-27}}</ref>

= Ethics of Media (Journalists) in the U.S. =

=== Why is Media Ethics Important? ===
News media journalists play a key role in informing American citizens about health, policies, scandals, and more. Inadvertently, news media journalist shape or influence the public perception of events and issues. In a democratic country like the United States, it is important to have information about issues that impact one's life quality, because citizens have the power to change them through voting. Additionally, news media can highlight injustices going on in the country or on smaller scales (states, cities, counties). Change from the people relies on information from the news media companies, which is why in the constitution the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protects this practice.

=== History of Media Ethics ===
As the government and the public began to realize the importance of journalistic influence, several organizations established a code of ethics. It first appeared in the United States in 1923 under the direction and approval of The American Society of Newspaper Editors<ref name="":3"">{{Cite web |title=About the USA - The Media in the United States > Media Ethics |url=https://usa.usembassy.de/media-ethics.htm |access-date=2023-04-30 |website=usa.usembassy.de}}</ref>. Soon after, the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] and Associated Press Managing Editor endorsed these ethics<ref name="":3"" />. Each of these organizations are still in practice today and still teach the same code of ethics produced nearly a hundred years ago.

==== The American Society of Newspaper Editors: Code of Ethics ====
The American Society of Newspaper Editors or ASNE follows six principles in the organizations code of ethics.

* In ASNE's first principle, they encourage all journalists to act responsibly. According to them, responsible journalists do not abuse the trust given to them by the public<ref name="":0"">{{Cite web |date=August 20 |year=2002 |title=ASNE Statement of Principles |url=http://www.asne.org/kiosk/archive/principl.htm |website=PBS}}</ref>.
* In their second principle, ASNE believes journalists should understand the importance of the [[Freedom of the press|Freedom of the Press]]. The Freedom of the Press is the voice of the people, and journalists should be vigilant to make sure it is heard<ref name="":0"" />.

The Society of Professional Journalists or SPJ follows four principles in their code of ethics<ref name="":1"">{{Cite web |last=SPJ |title=SPJ Code of Ethics - Society of Professional Journalists |url=https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp |access-date=2023-04-30 |website=www.spj.org |language=en}}</ref>.

* In their first principle, SPJ believes journalists should seek and report the truth, which means journalists should prioritize the accuracy of their work over being the first to break the latest news story<ref name="":1"" />.
* The second principle emphasizes that journalists should not cause harm to others. SPJ believes journalists should show compassion for others and consider other people's perspectives or situations<ref name="":1"" />.
* In the third principle, SPJ encourages journalists to act independently, which means they should avoid conflicts of interest. Additionally, they should not accept anything for personal gain while reporting a short<ref name="":1"" />.

Several decades later, the role of journalists in media began to shift, specifically in the 1960s. Journalists during this period took the position of ""watchdog."" They were giving American citizens updates about the Vietnam War, which fields the negativity surrounding the war<ref name="":3"" />. Soon after, two journalists, Bob Wood Ward, and Carl Bernstein, revealed incriminating evidence against Richard Nixon that made him resign<ref name="":3"" />. Journalist's role as watchdog landed them on trial with the U.S. Supreme Court because the government believed they are interfering with safety protocols<ref name="":3"" />. Despite journalists' best efforts, the American citizens trust began to waver because they questioned their ethics and intentions for breaking stories. {{Dashboard.wikiedu.org draft template/about this sandbox}}

'''Pot Roast''' (2014-February 16, 2022) was an American cat from [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] who went viral on [[TikTok]] for her bedraggled appearance. She was owned by an anonymous woman who goes by Pot Roast's Mom online due to privacy concerns.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite web |last=Sung |first=Morgan |date=4 March 2022 |title=TikTok-famous cat's death underscores dangers of parasocial relationships |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/tiktok-famous-cat-died-devastated-fans-lashed-rcna18185 |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=NBC News |language=en}}</ref>

Pot Roast was adopted as a kitten in 2014, when her owner met her at an event hosted by the [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]].<ref name="":1"">{{Cite web |date=2021-05-24 |title=Pot Roast is KC's viral TikTok feline celeb |url=https://www.thepitchkc.com/pot-roast-is-kcs-tiktok-viral-feline-celeb/ |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=The Pitch |language=en-US}}</ref> Her owner, a student at the time, kept the kitten in her [[Fraternities and sororities|sorority]] house for a week, but due to the house's no-pet rule, the kitten took up residence in the neighboring fraternity house.<ref name="":2"">{{Cite web |last=Dodgson |first=Lindsay |title=Fans are heartbroken on learning the beloved TikTok famous cat Pot Roast has died |url=https://www.insider.com/beloved-tiktok-famous-cat-pot-roast-has-died-fans-heartbroken-2022-2 |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=Insider |language=en-US}}</ref> The shelter was not forthcoming about all of the cat's health problems, including [[Feline viral rhinotracheitis|feline herpes]] and [[stomatitis]] (which resulted in all of her teeth eventually being extracted).<ref name="":1"" />

== Background ==
With the victory of  [[Timur]] during the [[Battle of the Terek River]] against the [[Golden Horde]] in [[1395]], he planned on devastating the [[North Caucasus]] because of their support for the Mongols in the [[Tokhtamysh-Timur war]]. Starting West, Timur undertook a short expedition into [[Circassia]], before sending some of his generals to complete the expedition. Meanwhile, he ravaged the land of the kings [[Burak Khan]], [[Kuli and T'aus]], and [[Pul Adi]].{{sfn|Хизриев|page=}}{{sfn|Ангуни|2013|page=58-61}}{{sfn|Хизриев|1980|page=11}}
== Prelude ==
With the fall of the fortress Pulada, [[Timur]] returned to his headquarters in the Pjatigorye region, organizing and preparing his troops for the final campaign in [[Princedom of Simsim|Simsim]]. Timur announced to the population of Simsim that anyone who obeyed would be pardoned, and anyone who resisted would be executed. However, this threat of the conqueror did not have the expected result, as evidenced by the hostilities that unfolded here<br>
Having won several clashes with the army of Simsim, Timur occupied the area surrounding the Northwest of the [[Terek River]]. While moving along the left bank of the Terek River, the Chechens conducted ambushes on his army, however he countered these ambushes by digging defensive trenches. Eventually, he reached the [[Sunzha River]].{{sfn|Хизриев|page=}}{{sfn|Ангуни|2013|page=63}}{{sfn|Тесаев|2020|page=97}}
== Battle ==
The army of the formidable Timur decided to move into the mountains of Chechnya upstream of the Sunzha and Argun. To do this, Timur wanted to cross to the right bank of the [[Sunzha River]], where the city of [[Grozny]] is now located. It was here, according to legend, that by order of Timur a bridge was built across the Sunzha, from which the crossing itself across the river in this place was called “Kopir-Astagh Timur”, that is, “the bridge of Timur the lame”.{{sfn|Хизриев|page=}}{{sfn|Тесаев|2020a|page=97}}<br>
The two armies clashed in the Khankala gorge, located Southwest of modern-day [[Grozny]]. A fierce battle began, however, a far more numerical superiority of the Timurids led to the dominance of the latter on the battlefield. Realizing this, [[Khour II]] retreated his forces, planning to conduct a [[Guerrilla warfare|Guerrilla campaign]] against the army of [[Timur]]. However, while trying to retreat, Tamerlane's army inflicted great losses on the [[Princedom of Simsim|Simsim]] army, almost leading to its complete destruction.{{sfn|Хизриев|page=}}<br>

'''Lappeenranta Fortress''' (Finnish: Lappeenrannan linnoitus) is a [[Fortification|fortress]] located in [[Lappeenranta]], [[Finland]].

== History ==
In 1649, after a visit to [[Viipuri Province|Vipuri]], the Governor-General of Finland, [[Per Brahe the Younger]], decided to establish a new town near the waterways. The land use plan was compiled in 1649 by Erik Nilsson Aspgren.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kaupunki perustettiin |url=http://www3.lappeenranta.fi/linnoitus/linnoitusmultimedia/historia/kaupunginperustaminen/a08.htm |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=www3.lappeenranta.fi}}</ref>

On September 20, 1652, the Diet of Stockholm decided to grant special rights to [[Lappeenranta]]. In early 1653, Erik Nilsson Aspgren handed over special rights to the governor Johann Rosenhan.

After the [[Treaty of Nystad]], in the fall of 1721, Sweden established a border commission headed by Axel Löwen, general and state counsellor. In 1722, Axel Leuven established a small garrison to ensure the crossing of the border and the return of refugees. [[Axel Löwen]], Johann Henrik Friesenheim and Brent-Olof Stockenberg then decided to strengthen Lappeenranta. To secure the Lapinranta bitumen trade, pits and frieze horses were set up and 112 soldiers were sent to protect the trading post. In 1723, the brothers Carl Friedrich and Anders Johann Nordenberg were chosen to design the castle along with Jacob Johann Faber. Most of the construction work was done between 1722 and 1728.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ruotsalainen linnoitus |url=http://www3.lappeenranta.fi/linnoitus/linnoitusmultimedia/historia/ruotsalainenlinnoitus/b07.htm |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=www3.lappeenranta.fi}}</ref>

When the Hat Party came to power in the late 1730s, it allocated additional funds to expand the fortifications, led by Adam Reinhardt Bruno. However, the fortification work was stopped by a small outburst of anger.<ref>{{Cite book |title=(fi) Suomalaiset linnoitukset, SKS, Saarijärvi, Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura, 2011 (ISBN 978-952-222-275-6)}}</ref>

== Russian Garrison 1812-1743 ==
At the beginning of Russian rule, the border guard regiments were often changed. The Lappeenranta fortifications were rebuilt in the 1750s. In the 1790s, the castle came under the command of [[Alexander Suvorov]], who continued to develop it as part of the fortification system of southeastern Finland. During the [[List of wars between Russia and Sweden|Russo-Swedish War]], the Saimaa (fi) fleet became the third garrison of Lappeenranta.

In 1785, during the Russian period, the Orthodox Church of Lapinranta was also built, making it the oldest [[Orthodox Church of Finland|Orthodox church of Finland]].<ref>{{Cite news |title= |pages=Suomi on venäläinen. Yle TV1, 15.2.2015. directeur: Tommi Pietiläinen, producteur Antti Seppänen, présentateur Juhani Seppänen.}}</ref>

== The camp of prisoners of war ==
After the [[Finnish Civil War]], the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards (Finland)]] established the Lappeenranta prison camp at the castle, which was notorious for the arbitrary executions that took place there. This camp had nearly 3000 [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guard]] prisoners, about 500 of whom were executed.<ref>{{Cite web |title=LPR 1918 |url=http://www3.lappeenranta.fi/museot/verkkonayttelyt/lpr_historia/artikkelit/PUNAISTEN_JA_VALKOISTEN_SOTA_artikkeli.htm |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=www3.lappeenranta.fi}}</ref>

He was a member of the [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]].

== Early life ==
Chaves was born on February 15, 1882, in [[Paraguarí]]. His parents were the Portuguese Federico Chaves and his wife Felicia Careaga, from Guaira, Paraguay.<ref>*{{cite book|author=|year=1998|title=Crónica Histórica Ilustrada del Paraguay III|publisher=Distribuidora Quevedo de Ediciones|isbn=987-9246-03-9}}</ref>

== Political history ==
Chaves, who received his [[law degree]] in 1905, was a longtime leader of the right-of-centre National Republican Association, better known as the [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]]. When his party served in a coalition [[government]] in 1946, Chaves was appointed to the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]]. He served as Paraguay's [[foreign minister]] from 1947.

He was elected for a three-year term in 1950 and later reelected in 1953. When Chaves tried to strengthen his regime by arming the national police in 1954, a [[1954 Paraguayan coup d'état|coup d'état]] led by General [[Alfredo Stroessner]] on May 4 ended his administration.

== Death ==
Chaves died on 24 April 1978 at the age of 96 in the city of [[Asunción, Paraguay|Asunción]], from natural causes. He was buried with full state honours; Stroessner attended the services. When [[Isidro Ayora]] died on 22 March 1978 until his own death, he became the oldest living state leader.

'''Ancient text corpora''' is the entire collection of texts from the period of [[ancient history]], defined in this article as the period from the beginning of writing up to 300 AD. These corpora are important for the study of [[literature]], [[history]], [[linguistics]], and other fields, and are a fundamental component of the world's [[cultural heritage]].

[[Chinese literature|Chinese]], [[Latin literature|Latin]], and [[Greek literature|Greek]] are examples of ancient languages with significant text corpora, although much of these corpora are known to us via transmission (frequently via [[medieval]] [[manuscript]] copies) rather than in their [[historical documents|original form]]. These texts - both transmitted and original - provide valuable insights into the history and culture of different regions of the world, and have been studied for centuries by scholars and researchers.

Through advances in technology and digitization, ancient text corpuses are more accessible than ever before. Tools such as the [[Perseus Digital Library]] and the [[Digital Corpus of Sanskrit]] have made it easier for researchers to access and analyze these texts.

==Quantifying the corpuses==
Two types of ancient texts are known to modern scholars – those that have only survived in younger manuscripts, but whose great age is undisputed (this applies to the bulk of the Chinese, Brahmi, Greek, Latin, Hebrew and Avestan tradition), and those known from original inscriptions, papyri and other manuscripts.{{sfn|Peust|2000|pp=252-253}}

Counting of the words in each corpus presents significant methodological challenges – in principle, every single occurrence of a word in the text is counted separately, but in the case of parallel transmission of literary texts, only a single transmission is taken into account. Just as the Book of the Dead and the coffin texts are only included in the number given for the Egyptian, the Greek and Latin literary works should only be counted according to one manuscript. If, on the other hand, tombs, royal inscriptions or economic documents of certain ancient languages often show a more or less identical form, this is not evaluated as a purely ""parallel tradition"". The [[Article (grammar)|definite article]] incorporated in languages such as Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek has no equivalent in most languages, so its frequency would significantly affect the comparability of numbers - this is excluded in the estimates below.{{sfn|Peust|2000|pp=252-253}}

This corpus also contains writings by the Church Fathers written in Greek. The vocabulary of Greek is completely recorded in the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae, which is published on CDRom by the University of California in Irvine. The currently available version E, in which all texts up to 600 AD and a selection of Byzantine texts from the following epoch are included in their entirety, comes to a total of around 76 million text words. In 1985, when the authors up to 400 AD were mostly scattered (2700 authors), but only 200 authors from the period after 400, the database still contained 57 million words (L. Berkowitz & KA Squitier, Thesaurus Linguae Graecae, Canon of Greek Authors and Works, New York 1986, p. xii f.).

Ehlers, Der Thesaurus Lin guae Latin ae, in Antiquity and Occident 14, 1968, 172ff.) and thereby nine (according to other sources: ten) million slips of slips accumulates. Even if the vocabulary of Latin up to the year 300 AD has not yet been precisely determined, it should be clear that it surpasses that of Egyptian but is below that of Greek. However, the rule of thumb often heard among classical philologists, that there are ten times as many Greek as Latin texts, is exaggerated, at least if one takes our time limit of 300 AD as a basis.</ref>

As with the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae and the Egyptian Dictionary, the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary (“Assyrian” means Akkadian as a whole, not just its Assyrian dialect) began with a systematic fragmentation of text. When, in 1948, 1,249,000 slips had been reached, the systematic fiddling was stopped and the index was only expanded to include selected slips, so that by 1964 around 1500,000 to 1750,000 entries had come together (I.J. Gelb in CAD Vol. A 7, Chicago 1964, p. xvi). In my estimation, however, this should only be a fraction of the entire Akkadian material. The Assyriologist S.N. Kramer is said to have estimated that there were 500,000 cuneiform tablets (most of the cuneiform texts are in Akkadian). Also of interest is the estimate by A.L. Oppenheims, Ancient Mesopotamia, Chicago 21977, p. 17f., that the private library Assur banipals found in Nineveh contained 1200 to 1500 tablets, the number of lines of which ""would probably reach, if not exceed in bulk, even the size of the M ahabharata with its 190,000 verses"". Far less than half of this library has survived and been published, but on the other hand there are of course many more texts than those in Ashurbanipal's library. Instead of a specific number, I'd like to conclude by conjecturing that the corpus of Akkadian may be of the order of Latin.</ref>

There are significant number of ancient micro-corpus languages. Estimating the total number of attested ancient languages may be as difficult as estimating their corpus size. For example, Greek and Latin sources hand down an enormous amount of foreign-language glosses, the seriousness of which is not always certain.{{sfn|Peust|2000|pp=259}}

==Preservation and curation==
{{see also| Archival science| Conservation and restoration of cultural property}}
[[Historic preservation]] and maintaining ancient text corpuses presents several challenges, including issues with preservation, translation, and digitization. Many ancient texts have been lost over time, and those that survive may be damaged or fragmented. Translating ancient languages and scripts requires specialized expertise, and digitizing texts can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.

==Corpus Linguistics==
{{main|Corpus linguistics}}
The field of [[corpus linguistics]] studies language as expressed in text corpora. This includes the analysis of word frequency, collocations, grammar, and semantics. Ancient text corpuses provide a valuable resource for corpus linguistics research, enabling scholars to explore the evolution of language and culture over time.

73694041,Eternal_functional_subordination,"'''Eternal functional subordination''' or '''Eternal subordination of the Son''' is a [[Trinity|Trinitarian]] doctrine which proposes a hierarchy within the trinity, where though the Son is ontologically equal to the Father, He is subordinate in role, obeying the Father in eternity.

Eternal Subordination is contrasted with the view held by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], where the obedience of the Son to the Father is only by virtue of His human nature.

The '''Sarandena''' ({{lang-el|Σαράνταινα; Όρος Οξιά}}) is a mountain in Greece with a peak of the same name, part of the [[Southern Pindus]] massif. 

== Details ==
{{more citations needed section|date= April 2023}}
The name carries both the highest peak at 1,923 meters above sea level and the entire mountain. Its alternative name in Greek is [[Oxya]], which comes from (The) '''Beech mountain''' — a name by which it is denoted in Bulgarian. In Bulgarian, the name of the mountain means [[roebuck]] or [[Macrolepiota procera]].

The northwestern edge of the mountain is called [[Kokalia]] ({{lang-el|Κοκκάλια}}) with the etymology of ""bone"" in Bulgarian or bones. This ridge connects the mountain with the [[Tymfristos]] massif to the northwest. To the southeast, the mountain is connected to a common ridge with Mount [[Vardousia]]. South of the mountain is another prominent mountain from the Southern Pindus — [[Kokinia]]. In this mountain is the most extensive ''[[beech]] forest'', and in Kokinia is the southernmost ''beech area''. Precisely because it is a Beech mountain, it is included in the ''[[Pindus]] massif'', although in antiquity this name was borne by the river with the settlement of [[Pindus (city)]], located in a straight line twenty kilometers southeast of the mountain. 

To the west of the mountain massif are scattered numerous mountain elevations which collectively bear the name Southern Pind. Among them the highest is [[Kaliakouda]]. 

Between the villages of [[Gardiki Omilaion]] in [[Makrakomi]] and [[Grammeni Oxya]] there is a mountain road along a pass on which the [[armatoles]] in the winter of 1828/29 kept the new Ottoman army from entering [[Kravara]].<ref>[http://www.dimosmakrakomis.gov.gr/episkeptes/axiotheata/386-oxua-sarantaina Οξυά - Σαράνταινα]</ref>

== Opposition to caste discrimination==
He was a victim of political caste discrimination during the initial days of his political life.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jul/04/india.world#:~:text=The%20former%20mayor%20of%20Coventry,a%20derogatory%20name%20for%20Dalits%5D.</ref> He faced caste discrimination from the Indian Brahmin and Jatt communities in Coventry because they could not tolerate him on the front lines of politics. Hence, they organised his deselection as a Labour Party candidate at the end of his one-year term in 1990. Because of his work within the Labour Party, he was selected from Binley and Willenhall Wards by all ""white"" members of the Labour Party in 1991. With their support, he won the election, and since then, he has carried on being selected as a Labour candidate and winning to continue as a Labour councillor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/caste/caste-discrimination-uk-theresa-may|title=Hindu Groups in UK Hit Back at British Government's Plans to Ban Caste-Based Discrimination|website=The Wire}}</ref><ref name=""auto""/>

'''Angus Football Club''' was an [[association football]] club from [[Forfar]] in [[Scotland]].  Although it was entirely unsuccessful as a club, it was instrumental in the formation of [[Forfar Athletic]].

==History==
[[File:Forfar Athletic 3–1 Angus, Scottish Cup 1st round, 1885–86.jpg|thumb|Forfar Athletic 3–1 Angus, Scottish Cup 1st round, 1885–86, from the Dundee Courier, 14 September 1885]]
The club was founded in 1880.  Although the first club senior club in the town, it remained a small outfit for the first half of its existence; with 25 members in 1882, it was still the smallest senior club in [[Forfarshire]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=M'Dowall |first1=John |title=Scottish Football Association Annual 1882–83 |date=1882 |publisher=W. Weatherston |location=Glasgow |page=143}}</ref> 

Angus first entered the [[Scottish Cup]] in [[1882–83 Scottish Cup|1882–83]], losing at home to [[Balgay F.C.|Balgay]] 1–0, a second Balgay goal not being allowed as the goalposts had been knocked down in the struggle around the ball.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Angus (Forfar) v Balgay (Dundee) |journal=Dundee Courier |date=11 September 1882 |page=4}}</ref>

A one-goal defeat was Angus' best result in the competition.  In [[1883–84 Scottish Cup|1883–84]] the club went down 9–0 at the strong [[Dundee Harp F.C.|Dundee Harp]] side, and in [[1884–85 Scottish Cup|the following season]] 5–1 at home to [[Strathmore F.C. (Dundee)|Dundee Strathmore]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Scottish Association Cup Ties - Northern District |journal=Dundee Courier |date=15 September 1884 |page=4}}</ref>  Angus was just as unsuccessful in its two [[Forfarshire Cup]] entries, losing 3–0 at home to Tay Bank of Dundee - a junior side - in 1884–85<ref>{{cite journal |title=Forfarshire County Cup |journal=Glasgow Herald |date=22 September 1884 |page=8}}</ref> and 2–0 at home to [[Dundee West End F.C.|West End]] in 1885–86.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Angus (Forfar) v West End (Dundee) |journal=Dundee Courier |date=28 September 1885 |page=4}}</ref>

===The cuckoo in the nest: Angus Athletic===

Angus strengthened in September 1883 by taking over the Forfar East End junior club, the East End side becoming the Angus second XI, taking on the name of '''Angus Athletic'''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Football |journal=Dundee Courier |date=26 September 1883 |page=4}}</ref>  This meant that by 1884 Angus had 37 members, but was still much smaller than any of the [[Dundee]] clubs.<ref>{{cite book |last1=M'Dowall |first1=John |title=Scottish Football Association Annual 1884-85 |date=1884 |publisher=H. Nisbet |location=Glasgow |page=70}}</ref>   The Angus Athletic took part in junior <ref>{{cite journal |title=Angus Athletic (Forfar) v East End Wanderers (Dundee) |journal=Dundee Courier |date=4 November 1884 |page=3}}</ref> and second XI competitions in the county; in 1884–85 the Athletics finished as runner-up in the Forfarshire Second XI cup, losing 4–1 to the Dundee Harp reserves in the final.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Forfarshire Second Eleen Association - Final Cup Tie |journal=Dundee Courier |date=9 March 1885 |page=4}}</ref>

The Athletics also occasionally played senior sides in friendlies.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Rob Roy v Angus Athletic |journal=Dundee Courier |date=12 November 1883 |page=4}}</ref>  In 1884–85, the Athletics played the nearby [[Lindertis F.C.|Lindertis]] side on at least three occasions, with wins of 4–2 and 6–1 (at home)<ref>{{cite journal |title=Angus Athletics (Forfar) v Lindertis (Kirriemuir) |journal=Dundee Courier |date=2 March 1885 |page=4}}</ref> and 7–0 away.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Angus Athletics (Forfar) v Lindertis (Kirriemuir) |journal=Dundee Courier |date=23 December 1884 |page=3}}</ref>

===Forfar Athletic formation and demise of Angus===

Senior football grew hugely in Forfar in 1885. Angus increased its membership to 60.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McDowall |first1=John |title=Scottish Association Annual 1885–86 |date=1885 |publisher=H. Nisbet |location=Glasgow |page=72}}</ref>  However, towards the end of the season, the Angus Athletic split away to form  a new club, '''Forfar Athletic'''.  Its last match as Angus Athletic was a 5–4 win over the Alpine club of [[Arbroath]] on 2 May 1885;<ref>{{cite journal |title=Angus Athletics (Forfar) v Alpine (Arbroath) |journal=Dundee Courier |date=4 May 1885 |page=4}}</ref> its first recorded match as Forfar Athletic was against Our Boys Rangers of Dundee on 16 May 1885.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Our Boys Rangers v Forfar (late Angus) Athletic |journal=Dundee Courier |date=18 May 1885 |page=4}}</ref>  The Forfar match secretary (James Black) had been the East End secretary in 1883,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Football |journal=Dundee Courier |date=26 September 1883 |page=4}}</ref>  and Angus' honorary secretary the previous season.<ref>{{cite book |last1=M'Dowall |first1=John |title=Scottish Football Association Annual 1884-85 |date=1884 |publisher=H. Nisbet |location=Glasgow |page=70}}</ref>  The new club acquired 40 members before the 1885–86 season started.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McDowall |first1=John |title=Scottish Association Annual 1885–86 |date=1885 |publisher=H. Nisbet |location=Glasgow |page=72}}</ref>  

The Athletics joined the Forfarshire Football Association in June, alongside the Angus.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Forfarshire Football Association |journal=Dundee Courier |date=19 June 1885 |page=5}}</ref> The key match between the sides came in the first round of the [[1885–86 Scottish Cup]].  It was Forfar's first match in the competition; it proved to be Angus' last.  Angus had warmed up for the match with a rare big win the previous week, 5–1 at Dalhousie,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Dalhousie (Brechin) v Angus (Forfar) |journal=Dundee Courier |date=8 September 1885 |page=3}}</ref> and took the lead in the tie, but did not take enough advantage of having the conditions in its favour in the first half, and went down 3–1.  On the Forfar side, eight of the players - Ogilvie, Christie, Stormont, Smith, Menzies, Anderson, Samson, and Lamond - had played for Angus Athletic in the Second XI Cup final the previous season, and one more player (Black) was the Forfar nominated umpire for the tie.  None of the Angus Athletic players was playing for Angus.

The result of the tie switched momentum to the new club.  By 1886, Angus was stuck on 60 members,<ref>The Angus formed a replacement Angus Athletics reserve XI which played one tie in the 2d Eleven Cup, losing 6–1 at home to Strathmore Athletics of Dundee; Dundee Courier, 21 September 1885, p. 4</ref> while the Athletic had risen to 150 members, and was one of the biggest clubs in the county.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McDowall |first1=John |title=Scottish FA Annual 1886–87 |date=1886 |publisher=Hay Nisbet|page=62}}</ref>  The nail was driven in in the Forfarshire Cup; Angus went out in the first round while Forfar reached the semi-final.<ref>{{cite web |title=Forfarshire Cup |url=http://sfha.org.uk/forfarshirecup.htm |website=Scottish Football Historical Archive |access-date=1 May 2023}}</ref>

Angus nearly had one slight moment of retribution against Forfar, in a friendly on 7 November 1885 at Station Park, in which Angus was 3–1 up at half-time and still 4–3 up early in the second half; however, the play was ""brought to an abrupt conclusion"" and the match abandoned.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Angus (Forfar) v Forfar Athletic |journal=Dundee Courier |date=9 November 1885 |page=4}}</ref>

Given this sweeping rise of a rival club, Angus shut up shop. its final reported match was a 7–2 defeat at [[Montrose F.C.|Montrose]] in November 1885,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Angus v Montrose |journal=Dundee Courier |date=24 November 1885 |page=3}}</ref> and it was struck off the association membership roll for non-payment of subscriptions in August 1886.<ref>{{cite book |title=SFA minutes 1884–87 |date=24 August 1886 |publisher=Scottish Football Association |location=Glasgow}}</ref>

==Colours==

The club played in 2"" hooped<ref>{{cite book |last1=McDowall |first1=John |title=Scottish Association Annual 1885–86 |date=1885 |publisher=H. Nisbet |location=Glasgow |page=72}}</ref>  blue and black jerseys and hose, with white knickers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=M'Dowall |first1=John |title=Scottish Football Association Annual 1882–83 |date=1882 |publisher=W. Weatherston |location=Glasgow |page=143}}</ref> 

==Grounds==

The club's ground was originally at Bankhead Farm, 5 minutes' walk from [[Forfar railway station]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=M'Dowall |first1=John |title=Scottish Football Association Annual 1882–83 |date=1882 |publisher=W. Weatherston |location=Glasgow |page=143}}</ref> owned by Andrew Christie.  When the club decided to move, it presented Mr Christie with a portrait.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Angus Football Club |journal=Dundee Courier |date=25 April 1884 |page=8}}</ref>  The Angus Athletic reserves played  on Market Muir.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Angus Athletic (Forfar) v East End (Brechin) |journal=Dundee Courier |date=26 November 1883 |page=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Taybank (Dundee) v Angus Athletic |journal=Dundee Courier |date=2 June 1884 |page=4}}</ref>

In the 1884–85 season, the club moved to [[Station Park, Forfar|Station Park]], shared with the new Forfar Athletic club.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McDowall |first1=John |title=Scottish Association Annual 1885–86 |date=1885 |publisher=H. Nisbet |location=Glasgow |page=72}}</ref>  The first match reported match played there, with the ""wet and sloppy"" pitch described as ""a field behind the station"", was an Angus Athletic game against [[Partick Thistle]] at the start of 1885, which ended in a 1–1 draw.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Partick Thistle (Glasgow) v Angus Athletics (Forfar) |journal=Glasgow Herald |date=3 January 1885 |page=2}}</ref>

The '''100 mm gun-launcher 2A70''' ([[GRAU]] designation: {{Lang|ru|2А70}}) is a model of low-pressure [[rifled cannon]]s designed in the Soviet Union by the [[KBP Instrument Design Bureau]]. Integrated into Bakhcha-U and Sinitsa turret modules, the gun equips the [[BMD-4]], [[BMD-3]], and [[BTR-90M]] [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s. It is capable of launching the [[high-explosive fragmentation]] (HE-FRAG) 3OF32 and 3OF70 projectiles, as well as the [[9M117 Bastion]] [[List of gun-launched missiles|gun-launched]] [[anti-tank guided missile]]s (ATGM) and related systems.

== History ==
By no later than 2006, the then-standard projectile 3OF32 was found to be underpowered. Being modified from the WW2 52-OF-412 projectile of the [[100 mm field gun M1944 (BS-3)]], it was designed to withstand a higher ballistic-performance gun and thus has too thick walls and insufficient explosive filling.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060621072410/http://btvt.narod.ru/4/bmp3mod.htm Боекомплект Бмп-З<!-- Заголовок добавлен ботом -->]</ref>

'''Knud Kittelsen Spødervold''' (24 July 1791 – 20 March 1848) was a Norwegian author and [[lay preacher]] and leader of the [[Strong Believers]] ({{Lang|no|Sterktroende}}), a theologically conservative Norwegian Christian movement in opposition to the [[Haugean movement]], with roots in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Church of Norway]].<ref name="":1"" /><ref name="":0"">{{Citation |title=sterktroende |date=2023-01-24 |url=https://snl.no/sterktroende |work=[[Store norske leksikon]] |access-date=2023-05-01 |language=no}}</ref>

== Upbringing ==
Knud Spødervold was born in [[Bjerkreim]], [[Rogaland]], Norway, to farmer Kittel Gulliksen and Marthe Rasmusdatter Osland.<ref name="":2"">{{Citation |last=Odland |first=Paul |title=Knud Spødervold |date=2022-06-29 |url=https://nbl.snl.no/Knud_Sp%C3%B8dervold |work=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]] |access-date=2023-05-01 |language=no}}</ref> He grew up on the Spødervold farm in Bjerkreim. During his childhood he received his education at the [[ambulatory school]] of the time. He was confirmed by provost {{Ill|Gerhard Henrich Reiner|no}} in 1807.{{Sfn|Thrap|1892|p=2}} When he herded sheep in his youth, he carried the Bible and the [[Augsburg Confession]] in his backpack. He has been described as an [[Autodidacticism|autodidact]].<ref name="":3"">{{Cite book |last=Skullerud |first=Aage |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1153911989 |title=Bondeopposisjonen og religionsfriheten i 1840-årene |publisher=Universitetsforlaget |year=1971 |pages=56–57 |language=no |oclc=1153911989}}</ref> In his youth, Knud is said to have been a teacher in Sirdal for some time. In 1813 his father's farm was divided between Spødervold and his brother Michel.

In 1811, Spødervold was 20 years old and became a soldier in the {{Ill|Vesterlenske Infantry Regiment|no|Vesterlenske infanteriregiment}}; due to the tense relations with Sweden, he was first ordered to [[Larvik]]. During his military service in 1813, Spødervold met priest {{Ill|Wilhelm Andreas Falck|no}} who lived on [[Nøtterøy]].{{Sfn|Thrap|1892|p=5}}

== Work as a farmer ==
After his military service, Spødervold returned to his homeland and found work on the farm of the priest {{Ill|Knud Wessel Brown|no}} in [[Jæren]].{{Sfn|Thrap|1892|p=24}} In 1821 he bought his brother Michel's share of their father's farm, and five years later – on 8 November 1826 – he married Joren Larsdatter Kvitlen (1806–1886).{{Sfn|Thrap|1892|p=7}}<ref name="":2"" /> They had eight children, but only five survived to adulthood. From 1825, he worked as a teacher and bell-ringer in Sirdal for a time.{{Sfn|Bang|1910|p=463}} In 1836 Spødervold and his family moved to the farm Efteland, and in 1842 they moved to Stavanger. He first leased land in Egenes, but later moved to the city and lived in great poverty. He is said to have received financial help from [[Haugean movement|Haugean]] lay preacher {{Ill|John Haugvaldstad|no}}.

== Lay preaching ==
In his time, Spødervold was known for ""his incomparable knowledge of the Bible"", and writer [[Arne Garborg]] refers to him in {{Lang|no|Fred}} ('Peace'){{Sfn|Garborg|1905|p=118}} as ""a farmer in Western Norway who belonged to the [[Strong Believers]] and wrote books in defense of this sect"". He was also referred to by writer [[Henrik Wergeland]] in the 1832 {{Lang|no|[[Folkebladet]]}},<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wergeland |first=Henrik |title=Henrik Wergeland – samlede skrifter. III. Artikler og småstykker, polemiske og andre |volume=1. 1821–1833 |language=no |chapter=Folkebladet: No. 45, Tuesday 6 November 1832 |chapter-url=https://www.dokpro.uio.no/wergeland/WIII1/WIII1205.html |via=[[University of Oslo]]}}</ref> a political and economic journal, as a prophet. Spødervold easily connected with people, and household devotions were common under his leadership.

In 1828, together with {{Ill|Anbjørn Asbjørnsen Varp|no}}, he held several meetings in Egersund, which were well attended. Together with {{Ill|Villads Tollefsen Bjerkreim|no}} he continued the gatherings in 1829. These meetings were reported and a complaint was sent to [[Provost (religion)|provost]] {{Ill|Jørgen Theodor Meldal|no}} by parish priest {{Ill|Andreas Peter Marquard Hartvig|no}}. Meldal forwarded the complaint to the bishop of Kristiansand, [[Johan Storm Munch]], who believed it was ""necessary by serious means to inhibit the nuisance of the so-called [[Läsare|''readers'']] of Bjerkreim parish going around to the villages and holding public religious lectures and speeches to the confusion of the like-minded"".{{Sfn|Bang|1910|p=464}} Spødervold and his followers were summoned to see provost Meldal and in 1829 were banned by him from speaking.

Three years later, in 1832, he and some friends, Villads Tollefsen Bjerkreim, and Torger Andersen Fotland, were again reported to the [[Ministry of Culture and Equality|Ministry of Churches and Education]] by Hartvig in Egersund for violation of the [[Conventicle Act (Denmark–Norway)|Conventicle Act]]. The act, in effect until 1842, prohibited lay preachers from holding private religious services ([[Conventicle|conventicles]]). Stavanger County then ordered {{Lang|no|[[fogd]]}} (bailiff) {{Ill|Søren Daniel Schiøtz|no}} to conduct an interrogation. But Schiøtz – because of his own religious views – had no reason to prosecute them. Schiøtz personally interrogated the defendants in June 1832 and sent the case back to the Ministry of Churches. Thereafter, nothing more was heard of the case, and Spødervold and his followers escaped further action.

In 1840, he had followers in a number of areas: Bjerkreim, [[Sirdal]], [[Åseral]], [[Høgsfjord]], [[Stavanger]], [[Egersund]], and [[Helleland]].<ref name="":1"">{{Cite thesis |last=Kasbo |first=Trond H.

== ''The Dispensation of God's Grace'' ==
[[File:Forside_1848.jpg|thumb|First edition of {{Lang|no|Guds nådes husholdning}} (''The Dispensation of God's Grace''), published in 1848]]
In his later years, Spødervold lived in Stavanger, where he settled in 1842, and it was here that he finished the book {{Lang|no|Guds nådes husholdning}} ('The Dispensation of God's Grace'), popularly known as {{Lang|no|Knudabogjæ}} in the local dialect. With its original 90-word title, it consisted of 360 pages of [[Officialese|dense, wordy]] polemic against Haugeans, the [[Moravian Church]], [[Quakers]], and others.<ref name="":2"" /><ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":3"" /> In the book, he takes the reader through the history of the Bible from the creation of the world through Moses and David and the prophets. He shows that there is a struggle between good and evil, between God and the devil. The only remedy against deception is knowledge – a right knowledge of God and his [[God's will|will]]. Through examples from history, he shows God's punishment when people do not want right knowledge and Christian enlightenment.

In the last four chapters, Spødervold shows himself to be a critic of contemporary spiritual movements. He first attacks {{Ill|Wilhelm Andreas Wexels|no}}, who allowed for the possibility of conversion after death. Spødervold disagrees entirely and argues that judgment comes after death.

Throughout his adult life, Spødervold had lived alongside the [[Pietism|Pietistic]] [[Haugean movement|Haugean]] revival and had also been in contact with [[Hans Nielsen Hauge]].<ref name="":3"" /> However, he had very little sympathy for Hauge and his views, since his teachings and writings were permeated by the system of works.<ref name="":0"" /> Spødervold believed that Hauge drove people ""from vices to virtues""{{Sfn|Spødervold|1890|p=308}} in order to win God's favor and grace. He rebuked the Haugeans for what he perceived as a legalistic, excessive focus on [[Works-righteousness|works righteousness]]. He also criticizes Hauge for his doctrine of the [[Eucharist in Lutheranism|Eucharist]], since Hauge denied that Christ's human nature was in the sacrament, i.e. he did not support the Lutheran view of [[Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist|real presence]]. Hauge emphasized rather the spiritual benefit of the Eucharist. With this starting point, Spødervold characterizes Hauge as a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]].{{Sfn|Spødervold|1890|p=310}}<ref name="":1"" />

In another chapter he rebukes the Moravian Church, which had taken root in Stavanger. He attacks their lack of enlightenment on the [[triune God]]; nor did they have the right knowledge about the word of God, [[Law and Gospel|the Law, and the Gospel]]. In Spødervold's opinion, they could not explain how a person was [[born again]] and [[Justification (theology)|justified]].{{Sfn|Spødervold|1890|p=330}} Spødervold's focus, conversely, was on justification through faith alone (''[[sola fide]]'').<ref name="":3"" />

In the last chapter, Spødervold takes a stand against the Quakers. They mixed the effect of the law and the gospel,{{Sfn|Spødervold|1890|p=362}} and they had a wrong concept of the Spirit of God. They did not regard the Bible as the word of God, and they rejected baptism and communion. Spødervold shows that the Holy Spirit does not work apart from his word, which is his medium of communication with mankind. God is in the literal word, and it expresses his will.

== Death ==
Spødervold died in Stavanger in 1848.<ref name="":2"" />

== Critique of Spødervold ==
[[Anton Christian Bang]] writes in his biography of Hauge that ""Knud Spødervold does not seem to have undergone any deeper penetration into the secrets of Christian life. On the other hand, a diligent reading of Luther's writings has given him a fairly clear theoretical insight into the doctrine of the justification of faith.""{{Sfn|Bang|1910|p=465}}

Bang also writes that there was a split in Stavanger around 1850. The background is said to have been that some held firmly to Spødervold's doctrine of [[baptism]] and rebirth, while others rejected it as heresy.{{Sfn|Bang|1910|p=466}} In the appendix to ''The Dispensation of God's Grace'', Spødervold wrote that in baptism one is not reborn to resemble the image of God. On the contrary, one is in Satan's kingdom from baptism to faith, ""although God preserves his established foundation"".{{Sfn|Spødervold|1890|p=405}}

== Contemporary accounts ==
A memory of Spødervold is preserved in a discussion he had with the provost Hans Lund, who met him one day late in the fall after everyone else had long since brought their grain in. ""The weather is good now"", said Lund, ""now you must see to it that you bring in the grain"". Spødervold was immediately ready with his answer: ""In the fullness of time God sent his son, and in the fullness of time I too will bring in my grain.""{{Sfn|Thrap|1892|p=7}}

Priest {{Ill|Alexander Lange|no}}, grandfather of writer [[Alexander Kielland]], came to Stavanger as chaplain in 1818 and left as provost in 1839. In his memoirs, he recounts his meeting with Spødervold:

: {{Blockquote|text=Knud Spjødevold from Birkreim parish also paid me a visit. He was a horrible man. His countenance and whole manner were so rough, wild, and almost beastly, that one could consider him capable of anything. He pretended to want to ask me for information concerning passages in the Old Testament, but all his questions were based on obscenities, so I seriously rebuked him and let him know that if he did not seek any other information, I would have nothing to do with him. He went away, and I never saw him again.{{Sfn|Lange|1905|p=158}}}}

'''''Wild Card'''''{{efn|{{nihongo||ワイルド カード|Wairudo Kādo|lead=yes}}}} is a 2001 [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[WonderSwan|WonderSwan Color]]. It was Square's first original title for the platform. The player takes on the role of a protagonist going through a series of freely-available scenarios, building the world based on character interactions. The world, characters and turn-based battle system are represented using cards.

Production, which lasted one year, was led by ''[[SaGa]]'' creator [[Akitoshi Kawazu]]. The main artist was [[Akihiko Yoshida]], while the music was scored by [[Kenji Ito]] in one of his last projects before going freelance. Selling 40,000 copies, the game met with a mixed reaction from critics, noting its experimental nature while praising the artwork. Kawazu would revisit the game's card-based style with ''[[Unlimited Saga]]'' (2002).

==Premise and gameplay==
''Wild Card'' is a single-player [[role-playing video game]] in which players take on the role of a character exploring the game's world. Everything in-game, from locations and characters to items, are represented through cards and static artwork.<ref name=""NTTwild""/><ref name=""SQEXinfo""/><ref name=""WCcharacters""/> Set in a world built on stories and belief, the story opens with a narrator recording the oral traditions of their ancestors, which are under threat of extinction. One of these stories tells of a mysterious bright light flew across the sky towards the edge of the world, with the narrator deciding to retell the story and guide the narrative based on how the people might have acted.<ref name=""WCworld""/> From that point, the player is tasked with guiding the narrative based on a selection of up to one hundred ""scenario cards"", progressing the game in a non-linear style.<ref name=""SQEXinfo""/><ref name=""WCworld""/>

[[File:Wild Card gameplay.png|thumb|left|All gameplay in ''Wild Card'' is presented using static artwork and cards.]]
Upon starting the game, the player is asked a series of questions which determines their starting character from nine possibles; the other eight are then met during the campaign as potential party members.<ref name=""WCcharacters""/> Scenarios are split into three types; finding a destination, fighting an enemy, and discovering and item or person. Progress through scenarios is entirely dependant on the types of cards players have equipped: ""swim"" cards allow them to cross water, and some cards can make travel through the scenario easier or harder.<ref name=""WCscenario""/> There is no overworld map or traditional dungeons, with the player instead selecting cards to choose their route through a scenario, sometimes encountering either obstacles that must be overcome using a skill card, or battles.<ref name=""WCfield""/>

Combat uses a turn-based system, with the player party having up to five members who can be commanded to attack or be the one to receive enemy attacks.<ref name=""SQEXinfo""/> Combat revolves around using cards which outmatch an enemy's attack or defense card values, with battles ending when one side is defeated.<ref name=""WCbattle""/> The goal is to reduce enemy health to nothing, which is done with standard attacks, skills, and magic abilities.<ref name=""SQEXinfo""/> Cards are limited in number and can only be regained upon completing the current scenario, with the player increasing the number of cards they can hold by completing scenarios and using ""Card Get"" point rewards to purchase new cards. The game ends if all party members are knocked out during battle.<ref name=""WCstrategy""/>

==Development==
In 1999, ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' developer and publisher [[Square (video game company)|Square]] partnered with [[Bandai]] to produce games for the [[WonderSwan]] portable console.<ref name=""IGNbandai""/> ''Wild Card'' was handled by a team led by [[Akitoshi Kawazu]], known for creating the ''[[SaGa]]'' series.<ref name=""FamSwan""/> Kawazu's team had transferred to working on titles for the WonderSwan console in 1999 following the cancellation of a [[PlayOnline]]-focused numbered ''Final Fantasy'' title.<ref name=""UnlimitedBook""/> Kawazu later noted that he handled much of the game's development outside programming and art.<ref name=""KawazuComment""/> He acted as the game's designer, Kazuhisa Murakami was programmer, while [[Shinji Hashimoto]] and Hiroshi Yamaji co-produced.<ref name=""WildCredits""/> According to staff member Kyoji Koizumi, development lasted roughly a year.<ref name=""KoizumiComment""/> [[Akihiko Yoshida]] created the cover and main art.<ref name=""BandaiInfo""/> The in-game illustrations and graphics were handled by a large team including Nobuyuki Ikeda, Kiyofumi Kato, Tonny Waiman Koo, and Toshiaki Matsumoto.<ref name=""WildCredits""/> The music was composed and arranged by ''SaGa'' composer [[Kenji Ito]].<ref name=""ITOdisc""/> It was one of Ito's last projects before leaving Square to become a freelance composer.<ref name=""ItoInterview""/>

''Wild Card'' was released on March 29, 2001, and was only compatible with the WonderSwan Color.<ref name=""BandaiInfo""/> The title was Square's first original WonderSwan game.<ref name=""WonderSquare""/> Two guidebooks were published alongside the game; one by [[DigiCube]], and one by [[Shueisha]].<ref name=""DigiGuide""/><ref name=""Guidebook""/> Due to the console not releasing outside Japan, ''Wild Card'' was not localized.<ref name=""RetroSwan""/> Kawazu later revisited the mechanics and presentation of ''Wild Card'' in the [[PlayStation 2]] title ''[[Unlimited Saga]]'' (2002).<ref name=""UnlimitedBook""/>

==Reception==
During 2001, ''Wild Card'' ranked among the top three hundred best-selling games, selling over 25,500 units.<ref name=""SalesFam""/> Square's fiscal report for that year reported the game sold 40,000 copies.<ref name=""Sales""/> In a preview for ''The Gaming Intelligence Agency'', Clifford Chao positively compared ''Wild Card'' to the earlier ''[[Arcana (video game)|Arcana]]'' (1992), noting its unusual card-based presentation and art style.<ref name=""GIApreview""/> Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave the game a score of 23 points out of 40, with several critics noting its unique style but finding its mechanics and progression difficult to adjust to compared to other games on the market.<ref name=""FamReview""/> ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' noted the game's experimental gameplay and praised Yoshida's artwork.<ref name=""RetroSwan""/>

The '''Prussian State Council''' '''of Nazi Germany''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Preußischer Staatsrat'') was an advisory body to the Prussian minister president from 1933 to 1945. It was the successor to the [[Weimar Republic]] body of the same name that represented the interests of [[Provinces of Prussia|Prussia's provinces]] in the legislative process. In [[Nazi Germany]] its members were either appointed by Prussian minister president [[Hermann Göring]] or were members as a result of their official positions in the state of Prussia. The Council met only six times and ceased to exist with the end of Nazi rule in 1945.

== History ==

=== Background ===
During the [[Weimar Republic]], the [[Prussian State Council]] was the second chamber of the bicameral legislature of the [[Free State of Prussia]]. Its members were elected by the Prussian provincial parliaments to represent the interests of the [[Provinces of Prussia|provinces]] at the state level.

With the [[Prussian Landtag elections in the Weimar Republic|elections to the Prussian state parliament]] ({{Lang|de|Landtag}}) that were held in parallel with the national [[March 1933 German federal election|Reichstag elections]] on 5 March 1933, and also with the elections to the Prussian provincial parliaments held on 12 March 1933, the [[Nazi Party]] was able to secure the necessary majority in the {{Lang|de|Landtag}} and in the State Council to pass a Prussian [[enabling act]] on 18 May 1933. It gave the Prussian state government the same powers at the state level that the Reich government had received at the national level through the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act of 24 March 1933]]. The Prussian minister president could make and implement laws without the involvement of the legislature. Through the enabling act, the State Council was deprived of its co-legislative and co-executive functions. Article 15 of the Prussian State Council Act of 8 July 1933 then dissolved the State Council in its previous form.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOPgCwAAQBAJ&dq=adenauer+braun+Staatsrat+Staatsgerichtshof&pg=PT63 |title=Renazifizierung der Bundesrepublik Deutschland |publisher=Books on Demand |year=2016 |isbn=9783741201547 |pages=63–65 |language=de |trans-title=Renazification of the Federal Republic of Germany}}</ref>

=== Founding of the National Socialist State Council ===
The ""Law on the State Council"" created a new body in line with the [[National Socialist]] worldview. It was a purely advisory body that consisted of members by virtue of office and members awarded the title of State Councilor ({{Lang|de|Staatsrat}}) who were appointed by [[Hermann Göring]] in his capacity as Prussian minister president. Members by virtue of office were the Prussian ministers and state secretaries as well as certain other office holders.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite web |date=10 July 1933 |title=Preußische Gesetzsammlung |trans-title=Prussian Law Collection |url=https://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/que/normal/que1456.pdf |access-date=24 April 2023 |website=Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe |language=de}}</ref>

Members had to be males at least 25 years old with a residence in Prussia. For those who were members by virtue of office, membership ended by leaving office. Appointed members' terms were ended by death, resignation, or dismissal by Göring.<ref name="":0"" /> Members of the State Council received an expense allowance of 1,000 [[Reichsmark]]s per month (from 1 April 1936, RM 500).

=== Meetings ===
Only six meetings of the State Council were held. It met for the first time on 15 September 1933 in the auditorium of the [[Friedrich Wilhelms University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelms University]] in Berlin. The second meeting was held on 12 October 1933 and the third on 18 June 1934, with a report by the minister of finance on Prussia's financial situation. The fourth session was convened on 21 March 1935, the second anniversary of [[Potsdam Day]] commemorating the reopening of the [[Reichstag building]] following the [[Reichstag fire|fire of February 1933]], and the fifth was on 25 June 1935. The last session was held on 5 March 1936.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Blasius |first=Dirk |url={{Google books|mmQ1eNzuQWoC|page=102|plainurl=yes}} |title=Carl Schmitt: Preussischer Staatrat in Hitlers Reich |publisher=Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht |year=2001 |isbn=9783525362488 |location=Göttingen |pages=102 |language=de |trans-title=Carl Schmitt: Prussian State Councilor in Hitler's Reich}}</ref>

=== End of the State Council ===
After the March 1936 session, the State Council was no longer convened, although it continued to exist. In 1943 [[Albert Hoffmann (Nazi)|Albert Hoffmann]] was the last member appointed to the State Council. With the fall of the National Socialist state in 1945, the State Council also came to an end.

'''Ann O'Connor Williams Harithas''' (June 12, 1941–December 23, 2021) was an American philanthropist, museum founder, curator and artist. 

==Early life and education==

Harithas was born in Houston, Texas, to Roger Pinckney Williams and Maude O'Connor Williams.<ref name=""obit"">{{cite web |last1=Fuentes |first1=Jessica |title=Ann Harithas, 1941 – 2021 |url=https://glasstire.com/2021/12/30/ann-harithas-1941-2021/ |website=Glasstire |access-date=28 March 2023}}</ref> Through her mother, she was a descendent of Irish immigrant [[Thomas O'Connor (rancher)|Thomas O'Connor]], who at the time of his death in 1887, was the largest land and cattle owner in Texas. During the 1930s, oil was discovered on the O’Connor Ranch; the find soon proved to be the state’s largest oil field.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sweeten |first1=Lena L. |last2=Forbes |first2=Jessica |title=Phase IB Investigations of the Proposed Site for Victoria County Station, Units 1 and 2, Victoria County, Texas |url=https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1212/ML12129A117.pdf |website=U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission |publisher=Geo-Marine, Inc. |access-date=27 April 2023}}</ref> Ann grew up in Victoria, Texas, and nearby Tivoli<ref>{{cite web |title=Mission & History |url=https://www.fivepointsmuseum.com/mission-history/ |website=Five Points Museum of Contemporary Art}}</ref> with a sister six years her junior.<ref name=""find"">{{cite web |title=Ann O'Connor Williams Harithas |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/235186623/ann-o'connor-harithas |website=Find a Grave |access-date=27 April 2023}}</ref>

Harithas loved Texas culture, enjoyed ranch life and befriended many O'Connor Ranch workers.<ref name=""wilcox>{{cite news |last1=Wilcox |first1=Jon |title=Statement from Five Points Museum |work=Victoria Advocate |date=January 7, 2022}}</ref> Years later, Harithas would celebrate her girlhood environs, the site where she felt ""most connected to the land and to all of nature,""  by commissioning a six-channel video installation, ''Aransas: Axis of Observation'', from artist [[Frank Gillette]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Harithas |first1=Ann O'Connor Williams |title=Aransas: Axis of Observation |date=1978 |publisher=Points of View |location=Houston, Texas |page=4}}</ref>

She became interested in art as a child, purchasing a [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]] etching at age 15.<ref name=""pete"">{{cite book |last1=Gershon |first1=Pete |title=Collision, The Contemporary Art Scene in Houston, 1972–1985 |date=2018 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |isbn=9781623496326 |edition=First}}</ref> She took art lessons until she was 16 and was mentored by her second cousin (once removed),<ref>{{cite web |title=Thomas O'Connor family tree |url=https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/thomas-o-connor-24-1zcp9j |website=Ancestry.com |access-date=28 April 2023}}</ref> painter  and naturalist Madeline O'Connor.<ref name=""found"">{{cite book |last1=Bunch |first1=Robert Craig |title=The Art of Found Objects: Interviews with Texas Artists |date=July 27, 2017 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |isbn=1623496047 |pages=66-68 |edition=Reprint}}</ref> 

Harithas was especially drawn to the medium of collage. She had a great aunt who cut images from magazines and pasted them into scrapbooks from which Ann learned her first words.<ref name=""find""></ref> Ann began with cut paper and continued to make collages, incorporating new techniques such as digital compositing and large format color printing, throughout her life.<ref name=""found""></ref> 

She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English from the University of Texas at Austin, and a Master of Fine Arts degree from Rice University.<ref name=""obit""></ref>

==Galerie Ann/Robinson Galleries==

She  married first husband, Thomas V. Robinson, in 1970.<ref>{{cite web |title=Marriage/Divorce Indexes |url=https://www.dshs.texas.gov/vital-statistics/marriage-divorce-records/marriage-divorce-indexes |website=Texas Department of State Health Services |access-date=27 April 2023}}</ref> Together that year, they established Galerie Ann in a building adjacent to the [[Contemporary Arts Museum Houston]] (CAMH). The new business was inspired by a meeting with Manhattan-based female gallerist [[Terry Dintenfass]].<ref name=""wilcox""></ref> 

The Robinsons had four children, three daughters and a son.<ref name=""find""></ref> When they divorced in 1977, Ann took over the gallery space and renamed it Robinson Galleries.<ref name=""pete""/> There, she showed work by [[Edward Hopper]], [[Arthur Dove]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Watts |first1=Elena Anita |title=Kachina dolls and cowboys inspire artist's work |url=https://www.victoriaadvocate.com/361mag/entertainment/kachina-dolls-and-cowboys-inspire-artists-work/article_73db6582-db51-11ea-b64b-233250f85981.html |website=Victoria Advocate |access-date=28 March 2023}}</ref> [[Jacob Lawrence]] and [[Norman Bluhm]], among many others. She was instrumental in launching the art careers of [[Mel Chin]] and [[Jesse Lott]].<ref name=""found""></ref>  

In 1974, she met [[James Harithas|James ""Jim"" Harithas]], the newly-arrived director of the CAMH. From her gallery, she witnessed a fistfight on the museum's loading dock between Harithas and Chicano muralist Leo Tanguma. It made a lasting impression.<ref name=""pete""/>

In 1977, she collaborated with the CAMH on an exhibition, arranged by Harithas, of her [[Kachina|Kachina doll]] collection.<ref name=""pete""/> She made generous donations to the museum and underwrote a program of visiting artists at the University of Houston.<ref name=""pete""/> She funded the [[Lawndale Art Center]] and supported [[Project Row Houses]]. 

In September 1978, she and Jim married.<ref name=""obit""/> The pair would be the Houston art scene's power couple for decades to come, devoting themselves to local and regional artists as well as those working with politically- and socially-engaged content.<ref name=""local"">{{cite web |last1=Gordon |first1=Amy |title=Houston art legend Jim Harithas has died at the age of 90 |url=https://localtoday.news/tx/houston-art-legend-jim-harithas-has-died-at-the-age-of-90-196401.html |website=LocalToday |access-date=31 March 2023}}</ref>

==Collages==

Harithas started showing her collages in 1978, the first as part of a group show at Delta Gallery in Houston. She would go on to exhibit in more than 50 shows in the U.S. and internationally. Ten of these were solo exhibitions at such locations as The Museum of Contemporary Art in Washington D.C., Betty Moody Gallery in Houston and The Nave Museum in Victoria, Texas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ann Harithas CV |url=http://www.deborahcoltongallery.com/International/sites/default/files/Ann%20Harithas%20CV_2020.pdf |website=Deborah Colton Gallery |access-date=28 April 2023}}</ref> 

In addition to South Texas painter Madeline O'Connor, she counted [[Hannah Höch|Hannah Hoch]], [[Lee Miller]], [[Alfonso A. Ossorio|Alfonso Ossorio]], Jesse Lott, Susan Plum, Mel Chin and Travis Whitfield among her influences.<ref name=""found""></ref>

She worked instinctively, letting the story unfold as she assembled collage elements. Hopi kachinas, [[Santo (art)|santos]] and other religious icons are prevalent in her work. In ''The Art of Found Objects: Interviews with Texas Artists'', she told author Robert Craig Bunch, ""Both Kachinas and the other religious components of my collages speak to essential and intimate spirituality, and each person who views the work has their own way of relating to this. I use Indian and Christian religious images, taking them out of their traditional familiar context so their 'spirit' can be more clearly communicated.""<ref name=""found""></ref>

As new technologies became available, she would digitally or photographically enlarge small works to enormous proportions. She was intrigued by the way the collages changed at different scales, even shifting the focal point and meaning.<ref name=""found""></ref>

==The Art Car Museum==

Robinson Galleries closed in 1980.<ref name=""found""></ref> 

Two years earlier, the Harithases met Larry Fuente, one of the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]'s premier ""glue artists,"" a counterculture junk art movement in which small found objects were used to decorate larger ones. In ''Ancient Roots/New Visions'', a show at The University of Houston's [[Blaffer Art Museum|Blaffer Gallery]], Fuente was represented by a toilet decorated with hundreds of beads, paste gems and a large statuette of the Virgin Mary. Ann was enthralled and bought it, but what she really wanted was one of Fuente's art cars. She commissioned one that took him and a team of assistants five years to complete.<ref name=""pete""></ref> 

The ''Mad Cad'' was one of eight monumental works brought in for ''Collision'', a show Ann curated at [[Lawndale Art Center]] in 1984. The 1960 Cadillac Sedan de Ville was encrusted with millions of beads and faux jewels; swan, duck and flamingo figurines; action figures; shoe soles and plastic horses, which resulted in a surprisingly elegant, if over the top, construction.<ref name=""pete""></ref> 

Soon after, Ann fashioned ''Swamp Mutha'' from a 1982 Monte Carlo in collaboration with Jesse Lott. Her passion for art cars, shared by her husband, would ultimately manifest in an [[ArtCar Museum|Art Car Museum]] and annual [[Houston Art Car Parade|Art Car Parade]]. 

The Art Car Museum, aka Garage Mahal, opened in 1998. The private, not-for-profit center is dedicated to contemporary art.<ref name=""car"">{{cite web |title=About Us |url=https://www.artcarmuseum.com/about-us/ |website=Art Car Museum |access-date=31 March 2023}}</ref> The museum's mission is to serve as ""an exhibition forum for local, national and international artists with an emphasis on art cars, other fine arts and artists that are rarely, if ever, acknowledged by other cultural institutions.""<ref name=""car"">{{cite web |title=About Us |url=https://www.artcarmuseum.com/about-us/ |website=Art Car Museum |access-date=31 March 2023}}</ref>

As with all of the Harithases' venues, the Art Car Museum also presents overtly political work.<ref name=""rail"">{{cite web |title=James Harithas with Raphael Rubinstein |url=https://brooklynrail.org/2008/06/art/james-harithas-with-raphael-rubinstein2 |website=The Brooklyn Rail |access-date=27 March 2023}}</ref>

==Station Museum of Contemporary Art==

The couple established the Station Museum of Contemporary Art in 2001 with the goal of providing ""a resource that deepens and broadens public awareness of the cultural, political, economic, and personal dimensions of art.""<ref name=""closes"">{{cite web |last1=Fuentes |first1=Jessica |title=Station Museum of Contemporary Art Closes Until Further Notice |url=https://glasstire.com/2022/12/15/station-museum-of-contemporary-art-closes-until-further-notice/ |website=Glasstire |access-date=28 March 2023}}</ref>

Post-CAMH and without a governing board, Jim Harithas was free to follow his curatorial passions: the work of local artists or groups of outside artists, often that of underrepresented or undiscovered voices of protest.<ref name=""closes""></ref> During its 20 years of operation, the Station Museum mounted shows that dealt with the concerns of Palestinians, Iraqis, the LGBTQ community, people of color, Indigenous Americans and others who question ""society’s morality and ethics.”<ref>{{cite web |title=Past Exhibitions |url=https://www.stationmuseum.com/past-exhibitions/ |website=Station Museum of Contemporary Art |access-date=2 April 2023}}</ref>

==The Nave Museum==

In the 2000s and 2010s, Ann served on [[wikidata:Q107318338|The Nave Museum]]'s board of directors and curated several shows. She also exhibited her own work in two solo shows. 

In 2007, The Nave organized a solo show for Harithas entitled ''The Collages''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brandon |first1=Aprill |title=""Thought provoking""  collages exhibited at the Nave |work=Victoria Advocate |date=March 1, 2007}}</ref> A second, ''Transformative Visions'', ran in 2013.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Astrain |first1=Carolina |title=Catch the Beauty Before It Fades |work=Victoria Advocate |date=January 17, 2013}}</ref>

As curator, Harithas mounted numerous exhibitions, including the following. 

* Jesse Lott's ''Standing at the Crossroads'' was a retrospective solo show of his ""urban frontier"" art.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brandon |first1=Aprill |title=Art, The Urban Frontier |work=Victoria Advocate |date=November 21, 2008}}</ref> 

* ''Tres Latinos'' brought together three Hispanic artists under the age of 30: painter/graffitist [[Carlos Donjuan]], printmaker Juan de Dios Mora and photographer Santiago Forero.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brandon |first1=Aprill |title=Exhibit showcases young Latino talent |work=Victoria Advocate |date=October 23, 2009}}</ref>

* ''Carter Ernst: Fur Bitten'' showcased the sculptor's surreal, colorful fabric, faux fur and ceramic take on the natural world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Carter Ernst: Fur Bitten at The Nave Museum |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1FRx0h6wCI |website=The Nave, YouTube |access-date=29 April 2023}}</ref>

* Susan Plum's ''A World in Glass'' presented glass works, prints and pastels united by the theme of light.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Brandon |first1=Aprill |title=Houston Artist Debuts New Art at Nave Museum |work=Victoria Advocate |issue=February 5, 2010}}</ref> 

* For Mel Chin's ''Funk and Wag A to Z'', the artist took over the entirety of the museum.  The exterior, fitted out as a ''Temple of the Gods'', was adorned with basketballs bunched like grapes and leaves made of basketball nets, referencing the relationship between popular culture and sports with a nod to The Nave's Greek architecture.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Doty |first1=Camille M.

==Five Points Museum of Contemporary Art==

April 16, 2016 saw the opening of the Five Points Museum of Contemporary Art, a ""gift"" from Harithas to the city of Victoria. She established the free-to-the-public institution following her tenure at The Nave as a place where she could make her own rules.<ref name=""rules"">{{cite news |last1=Wilcox |first1=Jon |title=Coming Soon, Five Points Museum of Contemporary Art to open |work=Victoria Advocate |date=April 7, 2016}}</ref>

The opening show, Noah Edmundson's ''Lost Worlds: New Drawings and Sculpture'' coincided with an art car parade through downtown Victoria. Some of the cars and lowriders, which Harithas described as South Texas ""indigenous culture,"" were then put on display at the museum.<ref name=""rules""></ref> 

Exhibitions at the Five Points largely involve art cars, but the museum has hosted work by some of Harithas' favorite activist artists. Shows she curated include: 

* Irvin Tepper's 2018 exhibition, ''Evidence of Phantoms Made Real Between Thoughts'' was a ""mystical visual exploration"" manifested through drawings, sculpture and video.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Garcia |first1=Laura |title=Museum to host 'Evidence of Phantoms Made Real Between Thoughts' |work=Victoria Advocate |date=November 15, 2018}}</ref>

*''Lowrider Excellence: The Leal Brothers'' featured ten award-winning cars created by the Corpus Christi artists.<ref>{{cite news |title=Plan Your Week |work=Victoria Advocate |date=September 4, 2019}}</ref>

* ''Salvaged Species'', an exhibit of Mark “Scrapdaddy” Bradford's work, was shown in conjunction with the 2019 art car parade. The artist's cars/hydraulic walking machines, kinetic creatures and other sculptures are constructed from scrap metal.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Watts |first1=Elena Anita |title=Victoria Art Car Parade to wrap up with  Exhibit, festival |work=Victoria Advocate |date=March 28, 2019}}</ref>

* For ''The Road So Far,'' Harithas brought together Jesse Lott and Travis Whitfield in a 2019 show reflective of the artists' deep roots in the South, urban Texas in Lott's case and rural Louisiana in Whitfield's. 

* Harithas organized ''Insurgent: The Paintings of Clark V. Fox'' in 2021. Using appropriated corporate and political icons, the artist's work attempts to dismantle the effect of capitalist culture on our consciousness.<ref>{{cite web |title=Insurgent: The Paintings of Clark Fox |url=https://www.fivepointsmuseum.com/clark-fox/ |website=Five Points Museum of Contemporary Art |access-date=29 April 2023}}</ref>

==Later years and death==

In 2012, Harithas experienced brain trauma that left her with significant memory loss. By assembling collages from family photos and images of her injured brain,<ref name=""founder"">{{cite web |title=Ann Harithas |url=https://www.fivepointsmuseum.com/about-our-founder/ |website=Five Points Museum of Contemporary Art |access-date=28 April 2023}}</ref> her faculties improved and she made a full recovery. The series of collages were presented in the exhibit ''Ann Harithas: Memory'' at D.M. Allison Gallery in Houston.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tommaney |first1=Jim |title=Ann Harithas Makes Art Out of Her Memory Loss and Recovery |url=https://www.houstonpress.com/arts/ann-harithas-makes-art-out-of-her-memory-loss-and-recovery-6377987 |website=Houston Press |access-date=28 March 2023}}</ref>

Ann’s last curatorial endeavor was the mounting of the major museum show ''Mel Chin: Points of View'' held in conjunction with his large-scale public installation ''Wake'' in downtown Victoria (2021-2022).<ref name=""founder""></ref>

She died in Houston on December 23, 2021, at age 80.<ref name=""find""></ref>

{{Short description|Brazilian historical museum}}

The '''Joaquim Felizardo Museum of Porto Alegre''' is a historical museum in the city of [[Porto Alegre]], capital of the [[Brazil|Brazilian]] state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. It is installed at Lopo Gonçalves [[Manor house|Manor House]], located at 582 João Alfredo Street.<ref name="":0"">{{Cite web |title=Museu de Porto Alegre Joaquim Felizardo |url=http://www2.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/smc/default.php?p_secao=278 |access-date=2023-04-28 |publisher=Porto Alegre City Hall}}</ref>

== History ==
Lopo Gonçalves Manor House, also known as Magnolia Manor House, was built between 1845 and 1853 on a farm on Margem Street (currently João Alfredo Street), in the [[Cidade Baixa, Porto Alegre|Cidade Baixa neighborhood]], to serve as the summer residence of [[Lopo Gonçalves Bastos]]' family.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Nogueira |first=Maria Lúcia Porto Silva |year=2016 |title=Mulheres baianas nas artes de escrita: tessituras de experiências, memórias e outras histórias (1926-1960) |url=https://teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/8/8138/tde-18082016-121955/pt-br.php |journal=University of São Paulo}}</ref><ref name="":1"">{{Cite journal |year=2011 |title=O Solar que Virou Museu: memórias e histórias |journal=Porto Alegre City Hall |location=Porto Alegre |pages=24}}</ref> 

Lopo Gonçalves, besides having kept several commerce businesses in the city, was also an alderman of Porto Alegre for two mandates, staying as a substitute in a third period. The Manor House was his summer home, since the Cidade Baixa neighborhood, in the 19th century, was outside the urban limits of the city, being considered a rural area. After his death, in 1872, and that of his wife in 1876, the property was inherited by his daughter, Maria Luisa Gonçalves Bastos, and her spouse, Joaquim Gonçalves Bastos Monteiro, Lopo's nephew and also a merchant. During this period, the Manor House became the family's permanent residence, and was expanded and remodeled by Maria Luísa: a small internal patio was built, a turret was added, and an old room was demolished.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":3"" />

For some time, researchers believed that the high basement served as a ''senzala'' for the slaves of the Bastos family. However, after recent research and cross-referencing of information with other Portuguese-Brazilian architectural works, it is believed today that the high basement served to preserve the house in case of inundation, since the area of the city where the Manor House is located was flooded. Possibly, the enslaved stayed at the house, both those who worked with domestic chores during the day, and the others, connected to rural work on the property. However, this type of organization could be much more oppressive for enslaved workers, since it greatly increases the masters' surveillance over their activities, decreasing the possibilities of articulation among them. Another factor that reinforces this hypothesis is the fact that Lopo only owned 14 slaves, a number that specialists consider low to justify the use of a [[Senzala|''senzala'']]. The third element concerns the very concept of the ''senzala'', which is always a separate structure from the house and aims to preserve the ""intimacy and daily life"" of the slave-owning whites.<ref name="":1"" />

As the city's urbanization progressed, the land was reduced in size. In 1946, the Manor House was acquired by businessman and lawyer Albano José Volkmer, who, along with his family, owned a candle factory downtown, and housed relatives in several rooms of the new house, now divided into three housing units.<ref name="":3"">{{Cite web |date=2021-01-11 |title=De casa de veraneio a patrimônio histórico: saiba mais sobre o Museu de Porto Alegre Joaquim José Felizardo |url=https://gauchazh.clicrbs.com.br/cultura-e-lazer/almanaque/noticia/2021/01/de-casa-de-veraneio-a-patrimonio-historico-saiba-mais-sobre-o-museu-de-porto-alegre-joaquim-jose-felizardo-ckjrg7v9w001m019w0vq6atb1.html |website=Gaúcha ZH}}</ref> In 1966, the Service of Assistance and Social Security of Economists (SASSE) acquired the property to build a residential nucleus for its associates. In order to do so, SASSE asked the City Hall to demolish the Manor House and open a road that would divide the property, which was denied by the General Plan Council and the Urbanism Division.<ref name="":2"">{{Cite journal |last=Zubaran |first=Maria Angélica |year=2012 |title=O processo de patrimonialização do Solar Lopo Gonçalves: o Solar que virou Museu |url=http://revistamuseologiaepatrimonio.mast.br/index.php/ppgpmus/article/download/234/202 |journal=Museologia e Patrimônio}}</ref> 
[[File:MJJF-06-interior.jpg|thumb|One of the exhibition rooms.]]
[[File:MJJF-02-Praça_da-_Matriz.jpg|thumb|Old photo of the Mother Church Square, from the museum's collection.]]
During SASSE's ownership of the Manor House, there was an abdication of architectural care and maintenance with the building, which severely damaged its structure. Under these conditions, the building had been occupied by people who could not afford to afford living in other areas of the city. Therefore, for a few years, the Manor House hosted a kind of [[tenement]]. With the Extinction of SASSE and its redefinition to IAPAS (Institute of Financial Administration of Social Security and Assistance), the administration of the building changed, with an exchange of the Manor House between the City Hall and IAPAS.<ref name="":2"" /> 

Since 1974, the building's status has changed due to its inclusion in an inventory of buildings of historical and cultural value in the city, which was an autonomous initiative of the incipient preservationist movement in Porto Alegre. At the time, the situation of the poor installations was taken to the local press by some members of the preservationist movement and, in 1978, a commission coordinated by historian and university professor Moacyr Flores was formed to transform the Manor House into the Porto Alegre Museum, which was temporarily located at 291 Lobo da Costa Street. The project was approved after pressure from intellectuals, preservationists, professors, and organized civil society; in 1979, the property was listed as a heritage building and, in 1980, the Secretariat of Education and Culture (at the time, SMEC) took on the responsibility of executing the project. The restoration took place between 1980 and 1982, under the guidance of architect Nestor Torelly Martins, and was carried out by the Knorr company. At the end of the restoration, the City Hall collection, which was the responsibility of historian Walter Spalding, was transferred to the Museum, and is still there today.<ref name="":2"" />

Originally called Museum of Porto Alegre, it had its name changed to Joaquim José Felizardo Museum of Porto Alegre by municipal law of December 23rd, 1993, in order to honor [[Joaquim Felizardo]], historian and creator of the Municipal [[Culture of Porto Alegre|Department of Culture]]. He was a professor of basic education and university education, teaching History, and was politically persecuted during the civil-military dictatorship in Brazil, being punished in 1968 by [[Institutional Act Number One|AI-1]] and [[Institutional Act Number Five|AI-5]], when he was arbitrarily expelled and detained. With the democratization, he returns to public life.<ref name="":4"">{{Cite web |title=História do Museu de Porto Alegre Joaquim Felizardo |url=https://prefeitura.poa.br/sites/default/files/usu_doc/noticias/2022/03/12/Hist%C3%B3ria%20Museu.pdf |access-date=2023-05-01}}</ref>

The museum underwent another restoration, and was reopened on December 17, 2007.<ref name="":4"" />

== Infrastructure ==
The museum houses the [[Sioma Breitman]] Photo Library, whose collection covers about a century and is composed of about 9,000 photos, all digitalized, that constitute the museum's Image Bank, which provides the public the possibility of conducting research in a self-service system through computers. It also presents the long term exhibition entitled ''Transformações Urbanas: Porto Alegre de Montaury a Loureiro'' ([[English language|English]]: Urban Transformations: Porto Alegre from Montaury to Loureiro), telling the story of the first urban development plans and the main works carried out in Porto Alegre between 1897 and 1943.<ref name="":5"">{{Cite journal |last=Silva |first=Welington Ricardo Machado da |year=2015 |title=Museu, exposição e cidade: o caso do Museu de Porto Alegre Joaquim Felizardo, Porto Alegre, RS |url=https://lume.ufrgs.br/bitstream/handle/10183/134678/000987226.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |journal=Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul}}</ref>

The museum also has an archeological collection with more than 180,000 pieces of evidence and miniatures of old [[Azores|Azorean]] houses. It holds temporary exhibitions, promotes courses, debates, workshops, and other cultural activities.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":5"" />

== History ==
The theoretical foundation for the practical application of ''MBS'' was laid in the work ""Разрушения и заграждения"" (1931) by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Military engineering|military engineer]] [[Dmitry Karbyshev]].<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":1"" />

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939 - 1945), and especially the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] (1941 - 1945), wide use in all types of combat found [[mines]] and explosive barrages. For their arrangement in the [[Battle of Moscow]], the Soviet troops for the first time in [[1941]] were used ''barrage squads'', later called ''mobile barrage squads'', which subsequently were successfully used in other [[operations]] of the [[Red Army]] of the [[Soviet Union]].

After the [[Battle of Kursk]] (1943) on the basis of the experience gained, it was concluded that the army command needed a permanent specialized reserve of engineering units, which would have the means of mechanization of mines, large quantities of mines and explosives of various types. As a consequence, the MBS became a mandatory element of operational structure of the Soviet troops, and in 1942 - 1943 the tactics of MBS in the offensive and defensive were practiced.<ref name="":0"" /><ref name="":1"" /> During the Eastern Front, the Red Army expended more than 70,000,000 different mines, including about 30,000,000 [[Anti-tank mine|anti-tank mines]].

== Basic provisions ==
The composition and equipment of a [[squad]] is determined by its objectives in combat or an operation, the availability of available forces and equipment, the composition of the enemy's troops, and the conditions on the ground.<ref name="":0"" /> When setting a mission, the MBS receives data on the area of location, movement routes, mine lines, and possible courses of action (bands).<ref name="":1"" />

On defense, the MBS holds behind the first echelon of its troops in the most likely direction of the enemy's main strike in full readiness to move out to the breakout areas. The primary purpose of the MBS in defensive operations is considered to be<ref name="":0"" />:

* Rapid erection of mines and explosive barrages and the organization of destruction on the directions of the enemy's breakthrough into the depths of the defense, in the areas of landing of [[marines]] and the like;
* Covering joints and [[wiktionary:flank|flanks]] of their troops with engineering barrages, as well as deployment points for [[Counterattack|counterattacks]] and counterstrikes;
* Increasing the density of barrages in critical areas of first-echelon unit defense.

On the offensive, the MBS follows the first echelon of troops in readiness to set up barriers at the mines indicated to it. 

On the offensive, the tasks of the MBS are usually<ref name="":0"" />:

* Organizing [[roadblocks]] in likely directions of enemy counterattacks and counterattacks;
* Covering the flanks of the [[Strike Group|strike groups]] and the entry points of the second echelons with engineering barrages;
* Setting up barrages in first-echelon units while securing them in captured positions.

An MBS formation can be established not only in the [[ground forces]], but also to solve certain tasks within other branches of the armed forces and branches of the military. For example, in the [[Navy]], the tasks of barrages on the high seas are performed by barrage ship units.<ref name="":0"" /> In the [[Strategic Rocket Forces]] of [[Russia]], units are formed to cover approaches to the facilities of the position area, block enemy [[reconnaissance]] groups and landing zones of [[marines]].<ref name="":0"" /> While conventional units and formations usually organize one MBS, troops defending a stretch of [[Coast|coastline]] create an additional MBS with [[watercraft]] or [[aircraft]] for placing anti-landing mines in the water. In military formations, two or three MBSs are created, one of which is equipped with [[Helicopter|helicopter vehicles]].<ref name="":0"" />

The organizational structure of the armies of [[Member states of NATO|NATO member states]] does not provide for the deployment and use of MBS.<ref name="":0"" />

'''Grešnici''' (trans. ''The Sinners'') were a [[SFRY|Yugoslav]] [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Zagreb]] in 1965. They are notable as one of the pioneers of the [[Yugoslav rock scene]].

== History ==
===1965–1975===
Grešnici were formed in Zagreb in 1965 by brothers Krešo (organ, piano) and Kruno Pavlić (saxophone, organ, piano, vocals), [[Vedran Božić]] (guitar), Vlado Bastajić (bass guitar, vocals) and Darko Jambrek (drums).<ref name=""janjatović93"">{{cite book|last=Janjatović|first=Petar|title= EX YU ROCK enciklopedija 1960–2006|year=2007|publisher=self-released|location=Belgrade|page=93}}</ref><ref name=""istorija198"">{{cite book|last1=Fajfrić|first1=Željko|last2=Nenad|first2=Milan|title= Istorija YU rock muzike od početaka do 1970.|year=2009|publisher=Tabernakl|location=Sremska Mitrovica|page=198}}</ref> Initially, the band performed covers of international rock hits, and managed to gain some local popularity, holding regular concerts in Tucman club in Zagreb.<ref name=""istorija199"">{{cite book|last1=Fajfrić|first1=Željko|last2=Nenad|first2=Milan|title= Istorija YU rock muzike od početaka do 1970.|year=2009|publisher=Tabernakl|location=Sremska Mitrovica|page=199}}</ref>

After their 1968 Yugoslav tour, on which they performed with new guitarist, Vaso Sarapa (who came to the band after Božić moved to [[Roboti]]), the band went on hiatus.<ref name=""istorija199""/> In 1969, the band continued their activity in the new lineup, featuring, beside Bastajić on bass guitar and Jambrek on drums, new members: guitarist Vlado Delač (formerly of [[Zlatni Akordi]]), organist Neven Frangeš and guitarist and vocalist Branko Blaće,<ref name=""istorija199""/> moving from performing covers towards performing their own material.<ref name=""janjatović93""/> The band had local success and gained media attention, Delač's compositions receiving praise, and Frangeš, who was 16 at the time, described by the press as a [[wunderkind]].<ref name=""istorija199""/>

During the first half of the 1970s, the band, led by Delač, went through numerous lineup changes,<ref name=""istorija199""/> but managed to release eight [[7-inch single]]s, with the songs ""Mali trg"" (""Little Town Square""), ""Dok sam bio zelen i mlad"" (""While I Was Green and Young"") and ""Rijeka snova"" (""River of Dreams"") becoming minor hits.<ref name=""janjatović93""/>

The band ended their activity in 1975.<ref name=""janjatović93""/>

===Post breakup===
In 1996, the record label Orfej released the compilation album entitled ''1970-1975'', featuring songs from the band's 7-inch singles, and, as bonus, recordings on which they performed as the backing band for pop singer Marijan Kašaj.<ref name=""janjatović93""/>

'''2020 Florida Amendment 5''', commonly known as the '''Extend ""Save Our Homes"" Portability Period Amendment''', was a proposed amendment to the [[Constitution of Florida]] that passed 74.49% to 25.51% in the 2020 election on November 3, 2020. The amendment increased the period during which a person may transfer ""Save Our Homes"" benefits to a new homestead property from two years to three years.<ref name=""usatodayresults"" />

== Overview ==
The amendment extended the application for portability from a two-year window to a three-year window. It required 60% support to pass,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Milberg |first=Glenna |date=2020-10-05 |title=Explaining Florida Amendment 5: Limitation on Homestead Assessments |url=https://www.local10.com/vote-2020/2020/10/05/explaining-florida-amendment-5-limitation-on-homestead-assessments/ |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=WPLG |language=en}}</ref> ultimately receiving 74.49% support. The affected article of the state constitution was Article VII, Section 4; Article XII.<ref>{{cite web |date=November 3, 2020 |title=ELECTION RESULTS: What Florida Amendments passed? |url=https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/politics/elections/election-results-what-florida-amendments-passed/77-b2bd89a2-237b-4515-beb8-836219f7e3b5 |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=firstcoastnews.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

""Save Our Home"" benefits in the state are typically between $25,000 and $50,000, which apply as a tax exemption upon transfer of benefits.<ref name=""usatodayresults""></ref>

== Background ==
State Senator [[Rick Roth]], a Republican, introduced the amendment, receiving unanimous approval within both chambers of the state legislature. [[Americans for Tax Reform]] and the [[Tampa Bay Times|''Tampa Bay Times'']] editorial board supported the amendment, while the [[League of Women Voters of Florida]] opposed it.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-10-07 |title=What to know about Florida’s Amendment 5: Extend Homestead exemption transfer period |url=https://www.clickorlando.com/results-2020/2020/10/07/what-to-know-about-floridas-amendment-5-extend-homestead-exemption-transfer-period/ |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=WKMG |language=en}}</ref>

Additionally, [[Florida Today|''Florida Today'']], [[Treasure Coast Newspapers|TCPalm]], the [[The Palm Beach Post|''Palm Beach Post'']], the ''[[Miami Herald]]'', the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'', and the ''[[Sun Sentinel]]'' all supported the proposed amendment.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sangalang |first=Jennifer |title=Amendment 5, vote yes or no on 2020 election?

== Case ==
Gil Grego Rugai would have embezzled more than 25 thousand reais to the company ""Referencia Filmes"", owned by his father, Luiz Carlos Rugai. For this reason, Gil was expelled from where he lived on March 22, 2004. Gil took care of the production company's accounting.<ref name=""auto"">{{Cite web |last=Paulo |first=Do G1 São |date=2013-02-18 |title=Relembre o caso Gil Rugai |url=http://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/noticia/2013/02/relembre-o-caso-gil-rugai.html |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=São Paulo |language=pt-br}}</ref>

Around 9:30 pm on March 28, 2004, Luiz Carlos Rugai and Alessandra de Fátima Troitino, Gil Rugai's stepmother, were killed with eleven shots at the house where they lived on Rua Atibaia, in the neighborhood of Perdizes, in the West Zone of São Paulo. The day after the fact, the street watchman said he had seen Gil leaving his father's house on the night of the crime, in the company of another unidentified person.<ref name=""auto""/>

== Investigation and conviction ==
A week later, the Technical-Scientific Police Expertise found the same cartridge fired by the weapon used in the murders in the student's room, at his father's house. On April 6, 2004, Gil Rugai was arrested after being indicted for double murder, but he denied the crime. The Prosecutor's Office alleged that it had as evidence the weapon used in the crime, found on June 25, 2005, more than a year after the murders, in the building where Gil Rugai had an office, as well as a footprint located on the broken-in door of the victims' house. , which is consistent with that of the defendant.<ref name=""auto""/>

Gil Rugai was imprisoned between 2004 and 2006, but was released by the Federal Supreme Court (STF). On September 9, 2008, he returned to jail after having his request for provisional release revoked at the request of the Public Ministry , for having moved to another city without notifying the judge; Rugai went to the city of Santa Maria to take the entrance exam.<ref name=""auto""/>

The defense appealed and the student was released from the Tremembé penitentiary , in the interior of São Paulo, on February 10, 2010. Gil Rugai's trial was postponed twice, in 2011 and 2012, because of requests from the defense, which asked the Justice to carry out a new DNA test on the blood collected at the crime scene and on the accused. In addition, he asked for clarification from an expert.<ref name=""auto""/>

In 2012, the defendant lived with his maternal grandmother, Conceição, and his routine was limited to going to mass every day. In 2013, he was sentenced to 33 years and 9 months in a closed regime for the murders, but judge Adilson Paukoski Simoni determined that the convict could appeal in freedom.<ref name=""auto""/>  Gil tried a new defense request in August 2020, but the Federal Supreme Court refused and upheld the conviction.<ref>{{Cite web |title=STF mantém condenação de Gil Rugai por mortes de pai e madrasta em SP e processo passa ao transitado em julgado, diz TJ |url=https://g1.globo.com/sp/sao-paulo/noticia/2020/11/25/stf-mantem-condenacao-de-gil-rugai-por-mortes-de-pai-e-madrasta-em-sp-e-processo-passa-ao-transitado-em-julgado-diz-tj.ghtml |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=G1 |language=pt-br}}</ref>

On November 16, 2021, Judge Sueli Zeraik de Oliveira Armani issued a decision allowing Gil Rugai to serve his sentence in a semi-open regime.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Justiça autoriza transferência de Gil Rugai ao regime semiaberto |url=https://g1.globo.com/sp/vale-do-paraiba-regiao/noticia/2021/11/23/justica-autoriza-transferencia-de-gil-rugai-ao-regime-semiaberto.ghtml |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=G1 |language=pt-br}}</ref>  On April 12 of the following year, at the request of the São Paulo Public Prosecutor's Office, the Justice revoked the decision and further determined that the Rorschach test should be performed .<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tribunal de Justiça cassa decisão que colocou Gil Rugai no regime semiaberto; ele também passará por teste psicológico |url=https://g1.globo.com/sp/sao-paulo/noticia/2022/04/12/tribunal-de-justica-cassa-decisao-que-colocou-gil-rugai-no-regime-semiaberto-ele-tambem-passara-por-teste-psicologico.ghtml |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=G1 |language=pt-br}}</ref>

'''Virgin Atlantic Flight 024''' was a regularly scheduled [[Virgin Atlantic]] passenger flight from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], to [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. On 5 November 1997, an [[Airbus A340]] operating the flight was forced to make an emergency landing in London [[Heathrow Airport]] after the left main landing gear didn't deploy. During the landing, the aircraft was damaged and after repaired. All 114 passengers and crew aboard survived, but 7 passengers were slightly injured during evacuation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Virgin Atlantic – Airbus – A340-311 (G-VSKY) flight VS024 |url=https://www.aviation-accidents.net/virgin-atlantic-airbus-a340-311-g-vsky-flight-vs024/ |website=Aviation Accident Database}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Peters |first=Luke |date=2022-11-11 |title=25 Years Ago: How A Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340 Landed Without Fully Extended Landing Gear |url=https://simpleflying.com/how-virgin-a340-landed-without-fully-extended-landing-gear/ |access-date=2023-04-30 |website=Simple Flying |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=1997-11-06 |title=Emergency landing 'all in a day's work' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/emergency-landing-all-in-a-day-s-work-1292333.html |access-date=2023-04-30 |website=The Independent |language=en}}</ref>

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft was an [[Airbus A340|Airbus A340-311]], registered G-VSKY with serial number 016. It made its first flight on 3 November 1993, and was delivered soon after to [[Virgin Atlantic]] on 21 January 1994. At the time of the accident the aircraft flew 19 323 hours. It was fitted with four  [[CFM International CFM56|CFM International CFM56-5C2]] low-bypass turbofan engines.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Airbus A340-311 Virgin Atlantic G-VSKY |url=https://www.airfleets.net/ficheapp/plane-a340-16.htm |website=airfleets.net}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=D-AIEL Lufthansa Technik Airbus A340-300 |url=https://www.planespotters.net/airframe/airbus-a340-300-d-aiel-lufthansa-technik/edzpvr |access-date=2023-04-30 |website=www.planespotters.net |language=en}}</ref><ref name=""Accident report"">{{cite web |title=Air Traffic Accident on 5 November 1997 at Heathrow, London |url=https://reports.aviation-safety.net/1997/19971105-1_A343_G-VSKY.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230405200441/https://reports.aviation-safety.net/1997/19971105-1_A343_G-VSKY.pdf |archive-date=5 April 2003 |access-date= |series= |publisher=[[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] |type=Official accident report}}</ref>{{Rp|page=10}}

== Incident ==
At 05:09 flight VS024 departed from the runway № 24L in Los Angeles with a 19 minute delay. While climbing, the crew noticed that it took the landing gear a bit longer to retract. However, because no warning signals came on the pilot didn't pay attention for it.<ref name=""Accident report"" />{{Rp|page=3}}

Flight to London was normal. At 15:04 while landing at runway № 27L a warning in the cockpit alerted that the left main landing gear didn't deploy. The crew completed a successful [[Go-around|go around]]. During the flight in the [[Holding (aeronautics)|holding]], the crew tried to deploy the gear using the gravitation, but it didn't work. Other variants weren't successful too.<ref name=""Accident report"" />{{Rp|pages=3-4}}

The crew decided to fly near the [[Air traffic control|ATC tower]], to check the landing gear status from the Earth. It was found out that the left main landing gear was stuck in partially deployed position. The crew tried to complete several manoeuvres to make the gear come out, but it didn't deploy. The crew was thinking to touch the runway with the right main landing gear and immediately go around, the idea was to shake the landing gear up. However, the idea wasn't tried, as it was too dangerous and the pilots never did this before.<ref name=""Accident report"" />{{Rp|pages=4-5}}

When the crew realised that it was impossible to deploy the left main landing gear, they alerted an emergency. The cabin crew started to prepare passengers for an emergency landing. In 16:08 captain saw, that only a small amount of fuel was left. He declared a ""[[Mayday]]"". The crew started to land the plane on runway № 27L, because at the landing the plane was expected to turn to the left, what would bring it away from the airport buildings. Also, the pilots wanted to land the plane on the right side of the runway, so it will have more space to stop until it will leave the runway. According to the checklist, after the touch down the crew had immediately turn off all 4 engines. However, the captain decided that after the touching only the 1st and 4th engine will be turned off, after the engine number 2, and finally the engine number 3.<ref name=""Accident report"" />{{Rp|pages=5-6}}

As planned, after the landing the 1st and the 4th engines were turned off, the 2nd and the 3rd engine were turned off as planned too. The captain tried to hold the left wing in the air as long as possible, what led to the engine number 4 (the outer right one) to touch the runway. As the plane lost speed, the 1st and 2nd engine touched the runway and caused a short fire. The tyres on the right main landing gear burst. When the nose gear touched the runway the plane started to veer to the left. As the plane came to a stop, the cabin crew started the evacuation, where 7 passengers were slightly injured.<ref name=""Accident report"" />{{Rp|pages=6-7}}

== Cause ==
The reason of the incident were the next factors:<ref>{{Cite web |title=ASN Aircraft accident Airbus A340-311 G-VSKY London-Heathrow Airport (LHR) |url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19971105-1 |website=aviation-safety.net}}</ref>

* Full deployment of the left main landing gear was prevented because the unrestrained end of the brake torque rod № 6 have become trapped in the keel beam structure within the gear bay. It jammed the landing gear in a partially deployed position.
* The torque pin which had connected the № 6 brake torque rod to the wheel brake had disengaged during the landing gear was retracted after take off from Los Angeles, allowing the unrestrained rod to pivot freely about the retained end.
* The torque pin and its retaining assembly had been subject to higher axial and torsional loads than predicted during aircraft braking in service. These loads were the result of elastic deformation of the wheel axle, brake and torque rod, and due to assembly without the correct axial clearance as a result of prior undetected displacement of the associated bushes. The precise mode of failure of the retaining assembly bolt, nut and cotter pin could not be ascertained in the absence of these parts.
* This design of wheel brake assembly had satisfactorily passed the related certification wheel brake structural torque test. However the latter contained no requirement to use a representative axle or other means to reproduce the axle deflections which occur during aircraft braking in service. In result it did't require post torque test strip assessment of brake assemblies, which resulted in a overstressing deformation which did not produce component failure.

== Aftermath ==
The aircraft was seriously damaged. 3 engines and the landing gear, the pylons, especially the one from engine number 2, were damaged. The runway 27L was damaged after the landing gear tyres burst.<ref name=""Accident report"" />{{Rp|page=8}}

Virgin Atlantic still uses the flight number 024 on Los Angeles—London route, but instead of the Airbus A340-300, there flies an [[Airbus A350|Airbus A350-900]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=VS24 (VIR24) Virgin Atlantic Flight Tracking and History |url=http://flightaware.com/live/flight/VIR24 |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=FlightAware |language=en}}</ref>

'''Alfred Josef Nikolaus Guntram, II Prince of Windisch-Grätz''' (Vienna, 28 March 1819{{snd}} [[Tachau]], 28 April 1876), a member of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemian]] noble [[Windisch-Graetz]] family, was a Feldmarschall-Lieutenant in the Austrian army and  major landowner.

==Life==
He was the eldest son of Field Marshal [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz]] and his wife (Maria) Eleonore of Schwarzenberg (1796–1848).

Like his 3 brothers, Alfred II joined the Austrian Army. During the [[Prague Uprising of 1848]], suppressed by his father, his mother was killed and he himself was wounded.

As his father's wing adjutant, he accompanied him in all his military campaigns. When his father died in 1862, he became 2nd Prince of Windisch-Grätz.<br> 
In the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, he commanded two regiments in the decisive [[Battle of Königgrätz]], which ended in defeat for Austria. He was seriously wounded by a stomach shot in the battle at Stresitz and taken prisoner.
After his release, Alfred retired from active duty and received several military awards and the [[Golden Fleece]] in 1866. He became military commander in [[Pressburg]] in 1869.

Never fully recovered from his wounds, Alfred II died aged 57 at Tachau Castle, the Bohemian family seat of the Windisch-Grätz. 

=== Marriage and children ===
In 1850, he married Hedwig Princess of Lobkowicz (1829–1852), who died 2 years after the marriage. Their only child was 
* [[Alfred III, Prince of Windisch-Grätz]] (1851–1927), [[Minister-President of Austria]].

'''Edgar Nkosi White''' (born 1947) is a playwright and author. He has written over 40 plays, and his work has been performed throughout the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.peepaltreepress.com/authors/edgar-nkosi-white|title=Edgar Nkosi White &#124; Peepal Tree Press|website=www.peepaltreepress.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.doollee.com/PlaywrightsW/white-edgar-nkosi.html|title=Edgar Nkosi White- Playwright Dramatist|website=www.doollee.com}}</ref>

==Early life==
White was born in [[Montserrat]] in 1947, and in 1952 moved to [[Harlem]], [[New York]]. He attended [[City College of New York]], [[New York University]] and the [[Yale School of Drama]]. He also attended [[New York Theological Seminary]]. 

==Plays and poetry==
White's first play, ''The Mummer’s Play'' was produced by [[Joseph Papp]] and staged at [[The Public Theatre]] in 1965, when White was 18.<ref name=""auto"">{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackplaysarchive.org.uk/explore/playwrights/white-edgar-nkosi|title=White; Edgar Nkosi &#124; BPA|website=www.blackplaysarchive.org.uk}}</ref> White's writing career began when the poet and writer [[Langston Hughes]] helped him to publish his first book collection of plays ''Underground'', in 1970. 

His play ''Lament for Rastafari'' was directed by [[Basil Wallace]] at Ellen Stewart’s [[La_MaMa_Experimental_Theatre_Club|Café La MaMa Theatre]] in March and April 1977.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.lamama.org/Detail/occurrences/1738|title=La Mama Archive|website=catalog.lamama.org}}</ref> This led to productions in England both on stage at the [[Keskidee Arts Centre]], and as a BBC radio drama.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackplaysarchive.org.uk/explore/productions/lament-rastafari|title=Lament for Rastafari &#124; BPA|website=www.blackplaysarchive.org.uk}}</ref> A production of White's play ''I Marcus Garvey'' toured Canada in 2011-2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stage-door.com/Theatre/2011/Entries/2011/3/17_I_Marcus_Garvey.html|title=Review - I Marcus Garvey - Theatre Archipelago, Toronto - Christopher Hoile|website=www.stage-door.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://litfest.ms/2010/authors/edgar-nkosi-white/|title=Edgar Nkosi White &#124; litfest.ms 2010}}</ref>

From 2010 to 2011, White was library writer in residence at the City College Library of the City University of New York, where he continued to write new prose and poetry, <ref>https://cohenlibrary.ccny.cuny.edu/circumspice/Spring_2011.pdf</ref> including essays on Langston Hughes (''Trance''),<ref>https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cc_pubs/1/</ref> and Ellen Stewart (''Ellen'').<ref>https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cc_pubs/4/</ref> In ''Ellen'', White recalls how he was dared to write his first play by [[Martin Sheen]]; and Sheen then presented the play, ''Mummers'' to Joe Papp.

In 2015, White published an autobiographical collection of essays and memories, ''Deported to Paradise'', which uses his experiences of growing up on Montserrat, and in New York, as a starting point for discussions of wide-ranging themes around inequalities, corporations, consumerism and the state of the world. He has also published many occasional poems and essays, such as ''In the Ghut'', in celebration of the birthday of Montserrat's Premier, [[Donaldson Romeo|Don Romeo]], in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.themontserratreporter.com/here-is-in-the-ghut/|title=Here is “In The Ghut”|first=Bennette|last=Roach}}</ref>

The '''Second Battle of Nagyszeben''' was a battle in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian war of Independence of 1848-1849]] fought on 11 March 1849 between the Hungarian army led by the Polish General [[Józef Bem]] and the garrison of [[Nagyszeben]], the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] headquarters of [[Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)|Transylvania]], composed by the Russian detachment led by Colonel [[Grigory Skariatin]] Austrian troops led by Lieutenant General Alois Pfersmann, and [[Transylvanian Saxon]] [[national guard]]s. Before the battle, Bem managed to make the commander of the Austrian main Commander-in-Chief of [[Transylvania]], [[Lieutenant General]] Anton Puchner think that he barricaded himself at [[Segesvár]], while he escaped, heading to Nagyszeben. While Puchner was trying to encircle Segesvár where he thaught that Bem was hiding, the latter headed through a quick march to Nagyszeben, where he defeated the Ruso-Austro-Saxon garrison led by General Skariatin, and captured the city. Hearing about this, Puchner suffered a mental collapse, as a result of which, the still much superior Austrian and Russian troops retreated from Transylvania. Thanks to this victory Bem reinstalled the Hungarian rule over the province. This victory was the overture of the victorious Hungarian [[Spring Campaign]] which leberated almost all the territories of Hungary from the imperial rule.

==Background==
After the [[Battle of Piski]] on 9 February, [[Major General]] [[Józef Bem]] was informed that the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian imperial]] troops had again invaded Northern [[Transylvania]], threatening the Hungarian possession of this part of the province.<ref name=""auto"">{{Harvnb|Hermann|2004|pp=192}}.</ref> Bem responded to this threat quickly, by bypassing Puchner, who prepared him a trap at [[Szászsebes]], and then he quickly reached North Transylvania and drove out the imperial troops led by [[Lieutenant General]] Ignaz von Malkowski.<ref name=""auto""/> 

Meanwhile, the main commander of the imperial armies of Transylvania, Lieutenant General Anton Puchner was in a state of near lethargy after the defeats of Piski and [[Alvinc]], suffered against Bem.<ref name=""auto""/> He had waited nearly a week to write his official report on the events of the week which passed between the [[Battle of Vízakna|battles of Vízakna]] and Alvinc, and he had no mindset to dictate it all at once: on 15 February he wrote a chronicle of the successes between 4-8 February, and only the next day pulled himself together to report to the main commander of the imperial forces from Hungary, [[Field Marshal]] [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz]] about the battles of Piski and Alvinc; although from these reports it was hard to understand if they were victories or defeats.<ref name=""auto""/> He felt that fate had once again done him an injustice. His losses so far had been 1,600 soldiers, 1,000 of whom were recovering their injuries in hospitals, writing to Windisch-Grätz, that he had captured 21 guns with the heroism and blood loss of his soldiers.<ref name=""auto""/> Bem had remained - as Puchner claimed - with 3,000 men and 2 cannons after Vízakna, and at the moment when he thought he had been annihilated, a single Hungarian relief force reinforced him, not only replacing his losses, but increasing them two or three times as they were before, while his forces were diminishing day by day, ''and under such circumstances the most brilliant victory won - I mean in its immediate consequences - will be a real defeat''.<ref >{{Harvnb|Hermann|2004|pp=192-193}}.</ref> He believed that Bem now had 6-8,000 men and 25-30 guns, so he did not want to attack until he had received reinforcements. He asked for help from both Windisch-Grätz and from the Austrian garrison of [[Temesvár]].<ref name=""auto1"">{{Harvnb|Hermann|2004|pp=193}}.</ref> His officers had previously tried in vain to persuade him to attack immediately, but only on 28 February - having been informed of Malkowski's attack in northern Transylvania - he finally moved out of his headquarters from [[Nagyszeben]], marching northwards. His intention was to clear the valley of the [[Küküllő]], beat Bem at [[Medgyes]] and then take [[Marosvásárhely]]. He asked Malkowski to advance from [[Beszterce]] to Marosvásárhely.<ref name=""auto1""/>

On 1 March Bem arrived in Medgyes. The next day, on 2 March, the imperial attack began at [[Kiskapus]], which was initially successful, but then the Hungarian troops retook their previous positions. ''We ran out of ammunition, so we were forced to retreat until we were resupplied, finally they ''[those whose job was to supply the soldiers]'' stopped us, but they did not supply us with ammunition, because there was none in the whole camp, but ''[they told us that]'' we had to attack ''[only]'' with bayonets and drive the enemy away, which we finally did, in the evening with a great noise, because we could make a noise better ''[scream louder]'' than they could, and we chased them all the way to [[Asszonyfalva]], ''[but]'' we did not chase them any further'' - wrote a participating soldier. <ref name=""auto1""/> Both sides suffered heavy losses in the fierce fighting, and the Hungarian artillery fired almost all its ammunition.<ref >{{Harvnb|Hermann|2004|pp=193-194}}.</ref>
	On 3 March, all of Puchner's troops arrived on the battlefield and attacked with a considerable advantage.<ref name=""auto2"">{{Harvnb|Hermann|2004|pp=194}}.</ref> At first the Hungarian troops held against their fire well, but the artillery of the imperial army inflicted increasingly heavy losses on the Hungarian artillery.<ref name=""auto2""/> Puchner's left wing pushed back the Hungarian right wing, forcing the artillery to retreat.<ref name=""auto2""/> Bem attempted to regroup his troops, but Puchner's infantry soon broke through the weakened Hungarian army center, and Bem ordered a retreat.<ref name=""auto2""/> Towards evening Bem received reinforcements, which stopped the advance of the imperials. Bem ordered an attack, but the enemy infantry repulsed it and forced the Hungarian infantry to flee. Bem was then forced to retreat towards [[Segesvár]].<ref name=""auto2""/> The Hungarian losses were at least as high as at Piski - i.e. about 700.<ref name=""Babucs"">Babucs Zoltán: [https://mki.gov.hu/hu/hirek-hu/evfortulok-hu/most-pedig-megyunk-nagyszebenbe „Most pedig megyünk Nagyszebenbe!”] Magyarságkutató Intézet, 21 March 2021</ref>

After the battle, in order to successfully resist an attack from Medgyes, Bem took position in the defensive earth works he had already built between Segesvár and [[Dános]].<ref name=""Gyalókay"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=55}}.</ref> Bem now had some time to reorganize his troops, and also received new reinforcements in Segesvár, which made him to plan again to attack Nagyszeben, this time hoping to finally occupy the Austrian headquarters from Transylvania, after his [[First Battle of Nagyszeben|insuccess from 21 January]].<ref name=""auto2""/>

Puchner did not pursue the retreating Hungarian army. The Austrian corps was very exhausted from the two days of fighting, which is why Puchner wanted to rest his troops on 4 and 5 March before moving on to strike a decisive blow at Bem.<ref name=""Gyalókay""/> 

Puchner, as he had received no reinforcements from anywhere, now had only the troops he had fought with in the [[Battle of Medgyes]], whose order of battle, according to Philipp August Joachim Freiherr von der Heydte - was this. The corps was divided into three brigades. The division commander was József Kalliány, the only general in the mobile corps other than Puchner.<ref name=""Gyalókay""/>

''1st Brigade''<br>
Commander: Colonel Van der Nüll:<br>

* 3d [[Battalion]] of the 31st (""Leiningen"") [[Infantry]] [[Regiment]],<br>
* 1st and 3d Battalions, 41th (""Sivkovich"") Infantry Regiment,<br> 
* one battalion of the 16th (1st [[Romanians|Romanian]]) [[Border Guard]] Infantry Regiment,<br>
* 2 companies of the 5th (""Prinz von Savoyen"") [[Dragoon]] Regiment,<br>
* one [[3-pounder gun|three-pounder]] infantry battery of the 5th (""Bervaldo"") [[Artillery]] Regiment,<br>
* one [[6-pounder gun|six-pounder]] infantry battery of the 5th (""Bervaldo"") Artillery Regiment.<br>
Total: 4 battalions. 2 cavalry regiments, 2 batteries. (2480 infantry, 180 [[cavalry]], 12 guns).

''2nd Brigade''<br>
Commander: Baron Colonel Stutterheim:

* 3d Battalion of the 51st (""Karl Ferdinand"") Infantry Regiment,<br>
* 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 63rd (""Bianchi"") Infantry Regiment,<br>
* 3d battalion of the 16th (1st Romanian) Border Guard Infantry Regiment,<br>
* two companies of the 11th ([[Székelys|Székely]]) Border Guard [[Hussar]]s Regiment,<br>
* one six-pounder infantry battery of the 5th (""Bervaldo"") Artillery Regiment,<br>
* one three-pounder infantry battery of the 5th (""Bervaldo"") Artillery Regiment.<br>
Total: 4 battalions, 2 cavalry regiments, 2 batteries (2530 infantry, 166 cavalry, 12 guns).

''Reserve Brigade''<br>
Commander: Baron Lieutenant Colonel Uracca:

* 3rd Battalion of the 24th (""Parma"") Infantry Regiment,<br>
* 3rd and Reserve Battalion of the 62nd (""Tursky"") Infantry Regiment,<br>
* one ""Uracca” [[Grenadier]] Battalion.<br>
* 1/3 Battalion of the Bukovina Border Guards,<br>
* 2/3 battalion of [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] [[Kaiserjäger]]s,<br>
* eight companies of the 3rd (""E. H. Max"") [[Chevau-léger]] Cavalry Regiment,<br>
* one six-pounder infantry battery of the 5th (""Bervaldo"") Artillery Regiment.<br>
Total: 5 battalions, 8 cavalry companies, 2 batteries. (2740 infantry, 580 cavalry, 12 guns).<ref>{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=56-57}}.</ref>

So the whole corps consisted of '''13 battalions, 12 cavalry companies, and 6 batteries (36 guns). The total number of its personnel (without the artillerymen and carters) was 8676 soldiers.'''<ref name=""Gyalókay1"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=57}}.</ref>{{efn|Puchner's report to Field Marshal Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz, mentions only 7452 soldiers, but Heydte's figures seem more likely, because Puchner, by talking about fewer soldiers, may have been trying to convince the main commander to send him more reinforcements.<ref name=""Gyalókay1""/>}} From this figure, however, must be deducted the losses caused by the battle of Medgyes, which were 322 men. Thus, the Austrian troops under Puchner, without the artillerymen and charioteers, numbered 8354, but with them, they could have reached 9000.<ref name=""Gyalókay1""/>

His victory at Medgyes made Puchner to make a bold to surround and destroy Bem's troops with attacks from several directions.<ref name=""auto2""/> The [[military operation plan]] of Puchner’s army was prepared by the [[chief of staff]] of the Corps - [[Major]] Maroičić.<ref name=""Gyalókay""/> Its basic idea was that a stronger detachment under the leadership of Major August von Heydte would feign an attack in the direction of the Medgyes-Segesvár road through [[Berethalom]]-[[Váldhíd]]-[[Erzsébetváros]]-[[Holdvilág]]-Dános,<ref>{{Harvnb|Hermann|2013|pp=77-78}}.</ref> make Bem to think that the main imperial troops are coming from there, thus luring him into the aforementioned defensive position.<ref name=""Gyalókay""/> Meanwhile, the rest of the corps would start its march on 6 March, bypassing Segesvár from the south, via Riomfalva (today a village of the municipality of Berethalom)-[[Bürkös]]-[[Szentágota]]-[[Hégen]]-[[Apold]]-Segesd (today a village of the municipality of Apold),<ref name=""2013b"">{{Harvnb|Hermann|2013|pp=78}}.</ref> cutting off the Hungarian army from the main source of its strength, [[Székely Land]].<ref name=""Gyalókay""/> At that time, Maroičić was still counting on the support of Lieutenant-General Malkowski's troops from [[Bukovina]], which, he thought, by the time Puchner reached Segesvár, should have reached Marosvásárhely (he did not know that Bem already had driven Malkowski out of Transylvania),<ref name=""Gyalókay""/> thus tying up part of the Hungarian forces in Székely lLnd, from where Bem expected his reinforcements.<ref name=""auto2""/><ref name=""2013H"">{{Harvnb|Hermann|2013|pp=77}}.</ref> Captain Count Alberti, with 1 1/2 companies of the 3rd Chevau-léger Regiment, starting from Medgyes, will [[Reconnaissance|reconnoitre]] the right bank of the [[Târnava Mare|Nagyküküllő]] and seek a connection to Marosvásárhely with the division of Lieutenant General Malkowski.<ref name=""Gyalókay2"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=62}}.</ref> The plan had one, but very serious flaw: it had too many uncertainties. If Malkowski didn't attack, if any of the encircling columns were late, if Bem detected the encirclement attempt, the whole plan could fall apart.<ref name=""auto2""/>
[[File:Anton Freiherr von Puchner Litho.jpg|thumb|250 px|Anton Freiherr von Puchner Litho]]
The quicker Puchner made his encircling movement, the less the Hungarian army could reorganize itself from the damages suffered at Medgyes, and the less he could strengthen itself by picking up reinforcements.<ref name=""Gyalókay2""/> But it was also certain that, it would have been inadvisable to attack Bem with a worn-out, exhausted Austrian army, after they covered the distance of 92 kilometers over hills and valleys on unmaintained bad roads, as it was planned.<ref name=""Gyalókay2""/> But, as we have seen above, this - and the waiting for Malkowski - was the main reason that caused Puchner to lose two days, and thus to lose the advantage won at Medgyes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=62-63}}.</ref>

The weather was also the worst possible: rain and melting snow, blizzard and frost alternated constantly.<ref name=""Gyalókay3"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=63}}.</ref> The road, which had been passable enough a day before, had now become a thick mortar, in which man, horse, cannon, and cart alike could only move forward with bitter agony.<ref name=""Gyalókay3""/> The retreating Hungarians' guns were also stuck in the mud on the Medgyes-Segesvár road, and it was only due to the sluggishness of the pursuers that they did not fall into the hands of the Austrians.<ref name=""Gyalókay3""/> Thus it was easily conceivable, therefore, that on the side roads, which were isolated from the heavier traffic and not sufficiently prepared, even greater obstacles were placed in the way of the Austrian corps.<ref name=""Gyalókay3""/> The malnourished and exhausted traction horses were soon exhausted, so that 6 pairs of oxen had to pull each cannon out of the mud.<ref name=""Gyalókay3""/>

Heydte reached Dános on 7 March, carried out the [[Demonstration (military)|demonstration attack]], but then, on the night of 7 to 8 March, on Puchner's orders, he marched from Dános via the Holdvilág-Erzsébetváros-[[Szászsáros]] route to Bese (today part of Dános) to cover the left flank of the main column during the planned attack on Segesvár.<ref name=""2013b""/> As Puchner had ordered three companies of the 62nd Infantry Regiment to occupy Medgyes,<ref name=""Gyalókay2""/> and Heydte had a battalion of infantry, two companies of border guards, five companies of the [[National Guard]]s from Segesvár and one and a half companies of cavalry if he had remained in his original position, he could have formed a considerable obstacle to Bem's march towards Medgyes.<ref name=""2013b""/> However, Heydte's departure from Dános left the Medgyes-Segesvár-Nagyszeben route essentially uncovered.<ref name=""2013b""/>

Heydte's appearance did indeed alarm the Hungarian corps at Segesvár, but after no battle occurred, and the enemy retreated at midnight, only his abandoned campfires glowed in the night until they too went out towards dawn.<ref >{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=63-64}}.</ref>

As seen above, Maroičić's operation plan was for Heydte's demonstrating detachment to lure Bem to a position between Dános and Segesvár, while Puchner's corps, behind the back of the Hungarians, would take Segesvár.<ref name=""Gyalókay4"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=64}}.</ref>

But for this to succeed, the demonstration at Dános should have taken place on the 8th, and not on the 7th, but before Bem could get news of the Austrian corps' approach.<ref name=""Gyalókay4""/> If the Hungarians didn't send scouts towards the south, Puchner might have been able to slip behind them undetected.<ref name=""Gyalókay4""/> But Bem was not so careless.<ref name=""Gyalókay4""/>

Maroičić, as can be seen from the plan, wanted to deploy Heydte's detachment in two directions, namely at Dános and Bese, but which, in the end, could not be sent either here or there, all the less so because he had not received any new orders to postpone the feigned attack until 8 March.<ref name=""Gyalókay4""/>

Puchner's bypassing column was thus thoroughly delayed on unpaved roads, in terrible weather conditions, thus on 8 March its brigades only reached Hégen and Apold.<ref name=""2013b""/> Because of the exhaustion of the soldiers, Puchner gave his troops a rest, and the two brigades at Hégen did not leave for Segesvár until the morning of the 9th, and Van der Nüll’s advance brigade from Apold departed only after their arrival at noon that day.<ref name=""2013b""/>

==Prelude==
On the 8th, Bem had a clear view of the situation, which showed that the Austrians would not attack from Medgyes with any greater force, because according to the reports he received, most of Puchner's corps was approaching from the south.<ref name=""Gyalókay4""/>

Bem now was certain that, the nearest part of Puchner's corps was 15 1/2 and its farthest part 22 kilometers from Segesvár, so he decided to undertake the daring operation of leaving the town, marching through Medgyes and [[Szelindek]], and quickly attacking and occupying Nagyszeben before Puchner could intervene.<ref name=""Gyalókay4""/> Puchner, because to the aforementioned rest from exhaustion of his troops, started his march on the morning of the 9th, just as Bem was leaving Segesvár. Without this rest he might have succeeded in surrounding Bem.<ref name=""Gyalókay5""/>

The Hungarian success depended primarily on how fast the corps was moving, whether the enemy was directly behind it, and how long it would take to occupy Nagyszeben.<ref name=""Gyalókay5"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=65}}.</ref>

So on the morning of 9 March Bem's troops left Segesvár.<ref name=""Gyalókay8""/> 

The Van der Nüll brigade left Apóld at noon on the 8th, where it waited for the other two brigades to approach, and therefore did not arrive to the vicinity of Segesvár until late afternoon, towards dusk: here it exchanged a few shots with the remaining Hungarian troops.<ref name=""Gyalókay5""/> The brigade's Staff Officer writes that Colonel Van der Nüll wanted to persuade the Corps' Chief of Staff to occupy Segesvár immediately.<ref name=""Gyalókay5""/> The latter, however, perhaps because Puchner had also held it back, was reluctant, and so the brigade received orders only at 9 p.m. to push into the town, which, according to the news received, had already been abandoned by the Hungarians that morning.<ref name=""Gyalókay5""/> Puchner with the Stutterheim brigade did not enter Segesvár until 2 a.m. on the 10th, and the Uracca brigade, together with the cavalry, moved in at 4 a.m., while the small Hungarian guard retreated towards [[Székelykeresztúr]].<ref name=""Gyalókay6"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=66}}.</ref> Puchner did not understand the gravity of the situation at all.<ref name=""Gyalókay6""/> According to the military historian Jenő Gyalókay, when it turned out that there were no Hungarian soldiers in Segesvár, at 10 a.m. on 10 March Puchner was still of the opinion that Bem was either marching to Medgyes, to [[Kolozsvár]] or to Marosvásárhely, and therefore he did not decide anything for the time being, because he was waiting for news of the approach of the troops of Malkowski and Colonel [[Karl von Urban]] and wanted to plan his further actions in concordance to their positions.<ref name=""Gyalókay6""/> But also on 10 March at 5 p.m., he wrote to Lieutenant General Alois Pfersmann von Eichtal, head of the garrison from Nagyszeben, that according to the latest reports, part of the Hungarian army was moving towards Medgyes and that it may happen that Bem wanted to ''scare'' the garrison of Nagyszeben.<ref name=""Gyalókay6""/> So, as he wrote further, to prevent this ''very unlikely'' event to happen, he will march with his whole army through Riomfalva towards Nagyszeben.<ref name=""Gyalókay6""/>

According to Puchner's calculation, Bem could not attack this city before 12 March; and its [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and Austrian garrisons could successfully defend it for at least 24 hours.<ref name=""Gyalókay7"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=67}}.</ref>

According to Heydte, the Austrian corps left Segesvár at 11 o'clock at night on the 10th, while according to Kalliány, 2 hours later.<ref name=""Gyalókay7""/> However, the Van der Nüll brigade, which was again put as advance guard, had already reached Dános during the morning.<ref name=""Gyalókay7""/> There the whole corps turned off the road from Segesvár to Medgyes and headed for [[Újegyház]] via Berethalom and Riomfalva, partly because this road was somewhat shorter than the other, and partly because the Austrians feared that Bem had destroyed the bridges behind him and tried to hold up Puchner's corps by occupying certain strategic points.<ref name=""Gyalókay7""/> The question was whether the Hungarian army would be able to take Nagyszeben before the pursuers arrived, or whether it would be destroyed in the ring of the defenders and pursuers.<ref name=""auto2""/>

Bem's troops reached [[Baráthely]] in torrential rain, drenched to the skin, at 2 a.m. on the 10th, and at 8 a.m. Medgyes, where three companies of the Austrian 62nd Infantry Regiment remained after Puchner's victory from 3 March.<ref name=""Gyalókay8"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=68}}.</ref> This garrison was joined, on the evening of the 9th, by Captain Alberti's scout troop.<ref name=""Gyalókay8""/> The Austrian outposts were stationed between Medgyes and Baráthely, and here they had a small skirmish with the Hungarian advance unit; but no serious fighting took place, for the Austrian troops withdrew from Medgyes towards Nagyszeben at 7 o'clock on the morning of the 10th.<ref name=""Gyalókay8""/> However, First Lieutenant Henter, who had been sent to Nagyekemező, was taken prisoner by the Hungarians along with 30 of his men.<ref name=""Gyalókay8""/> 

Bem left behind 1000 rearguards at Medgyes,<ref name=""auto2""/> while others say 1500 soldiers and 4 guns, led by [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Pereczy.<ref name=""Gyalókay9"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=69}}.</ref> In addition, as a mobile flank defence, Bem sent a detachment led by Lieutenant-Colonel Count Gergely Bethlen towards Dános-Váldhíd-Berethalom-Musna-Ivánfalva-Kiskapus at noon on the 9th.<ref name=""Gyalókay9""/> Bem's army arrived at [[Nagyselyk]] at 1 a.m. on 11 March, and after some rest continued on its way to Szelindek. From here he departed at noon, on the way he scattered a Russian [[Cossack]] troop and reached [[Nagycsűr]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hermann|2013|pp=79}}.</ref> Towards 4 p.m. he marched out from Nagycsűr, at its southern exit, behind the Alter Berg (Old Hill), which separates this village from Nagyszeben, and here he deployed his army in battle formation.<ref name=""Gyalókay10"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=70}}.</ref><ref name=""Bánlaky"">Bánlaky József: [https://mek.oszk.hu/09400/09477/html/0021/2199.html Nagy-Szeben bevétele. 1849. március 11-én.

In 1849, Nagyszeben was the most important city in Transylvania for the imperials. It was the headquarters of the Austrian troops from Transylvania called ''General-Commando'' and the main armament and equipment depot of the Transylvanian [[K.u.K.]] Corps, where a lot of clothing, weapons and ammunition, as well as all kinds of other war material were stockpiled.<ref name=""Gyalókay10""/> The ''Königsboden'' (King's Land) where the most Transylvanian Saxons lived, and which's center was Nagyszeben, also provided plenty of men for the war, and so this region was in fact the base of operations for the Austrian corps in Transylvania.<ref name=""Gyalókay10""/> Its importance was increased by the fact that at the beginning of February Windisch-Grätz authorized Puchner to retreat to [[Wallachia]] if necessary.<ref name=""Gyalókay10""/> The [[Turnu Roșu Pass|Vöröstorony]] (Red Tower) Pass, the most easily accessible link between Transylvania and Wallachia, has its northern entrance below Nagyszeben: the loss of this city could cut off this route and force the Austrian army, which might be forced to leave Transylvania, to take the [[Rucăr-Bran Pass|Törcsvár]] or [[Predeal Pass|Tömös Pass]] by a long detour.<ref name=""Gyalókay10""/>

On 10 March, in the afternoon, Puchner himself had already thought - though he did not really believe - that Bem could attack Sibiu.<ref name=""Gyalókay10""/> He, therefore, marched towards it, confident that the city was adequately prepared and well-equipped for defense, and would be able to defend itself until the arrival of the Austrian relief corps.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=70-71}}.</ref> It was surrounded by a strong and high circular wall, interrupted by towers, and in 1702 King [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] ordered the construction of a [[citadel]] with a bastioned [[façade]].<ref name=""Gyalókay11"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=71}}.</ref> By 1777, only traces of this fortress, built of earth, remained. In the course of time, parts of the city walls were demolished and it was only in November 1848 that the reconstruction of Nagyszeben was started, in order to become a defensible fortress.<ref name=""Gyalókay11""/>

It was no perimeter wall on the southeast side of the town. A temporary fortification - with an earth and pile wall - compensated for its absence.<ref name=""Gyalókay11""/> The [[Cibin|Szeben]] river, which flows on one side of the city center, replaced the main ditch.<ref name=""Gyalókay11""/> The suburbs were surrounded by earthworks and their surroundings were artificially flooded, where it was possible, with the swollen water of the river.<ref name=""Gyalókay11""/> Every street in the town leading to the defenses was blocked off with a pile barrier or barricade.<ref name=""Gyalókay11""/> The perimeter walls were equipped for the positioning of cannons on them; defensive corridors were built around them and [[embrasure]]s were cut into them.<ref name=""Gyalókay11""/>

So everything seemed to be in place for the successful defense of the city, and Puchner was not unreasonably confident that Bem would not be able to take Nagyszeben in less than 24 hours.<ref name=""Gyalókay11""/>
[[File:G. Skaryatin.jpg|left|thumb|250 px|Grigory Skaryatin]]
The battlefield of 11 March was divided into three distinct parts. The first is the Alter Berg and its immediate surroundings, the second was the small plain between the Alter Berg and Nagyszeben, and the third was the city itself.ref>{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=73-74}}.</ref>

Nagycsűr was built in the Krummbach stream’s valley. On its southern side, Alter Berg rose more than 100 meters above the village, and the slope towards Sibiu was covered with vineyards. The rest of the hill was barren.<ref name=""Gyalókay14"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=74}}.</ref> The plain at the southern foothills, interspersed with small willows and serving mainly as a pasture, in addition to several waterways, was crisscrossed by draining ditches in all directions, which were hindering, in particular, the rapid movement of cavalry and artillery.<ref name=""Gyalókay14""/>

On the afternoon of March 10, the Austrian troops retreating from Medgyes brought the alarming news of Bem's approach.<ref name=""Gyalókay14""/> The leader of the Russian troops at Nagyszeben, Colonel [[Grigory Skariatin]], at 5 p.m. that afternoon, launched a battalion and two cannons each at Szelindek and Vízakna, not being sure of the direction of Bem’s attack. At the same time, he ordered his troops stationed at [[Nagytalmács]] to come to Nagyszeben, and they arrived during the night.<ref name=""Gyalókay14""/> On the 11th the Russian battalion sent to Szelindek withdrew from the Hungarians without a fight, and together with the battalion sent to Vízakna retreated towards Nagyszeben.<ref name=""Gyalókay14""/>

At the same time, Pfersmann urgently wrote to Puchner that the situation in Nagyszeben was indeed critical and that the city would not be able to resist Bem's army for long. He, therefore, asked for urgent help.<ref name=""Gyalókay15""/>

However, Lieutenant-General Pfersmann and Colonel Grigory Skariatin did not seem too worried about Bem's troops, and, somewhat overconfident, instead of remaining behind the city walls, they marched out in front of them, did not occupy the city defenses, nor did they use the artillery on the walls.<ref name=""auto2""/> This may have been due to the fact that the commanders of the forces defending Nagyszeben, hearing of Bem's defeat at Medgyes, believed that the disorganized units of the defeated army had arrived in front of the city, and they hoped to give them the coup de grâce.<ref name=""Babucs""/>

The Hungarian army that arrived under Nagyszeben had covered 85 kilometers in 53 hours, so they could not be called well-rested by any meaning.<ref name=""auto2""/>

===Opposing forces===
Bem had around 4500-4700 soldiers, the total number of the army defending the city was around 6000.<ref name=""2013i""/> 

The composition of the '''Troops from Nagyszeben''', as can be seen from the official report of 1 April 1849, was as follows:<ref name=""Gyalókay12"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=72}}.</ref>

==Battle==
===The open battle===
Skariatin himself now set off with the rest of his troops to occupy the top of the Alten Berg; but he was too late, and settled at the foot of the hill, instead of taking the roof.<ref name=""Gyalókay14""/> Only a single line of [[skirmisher]]s pushed up the slope into the vineyards; but the bulk of the infantry, with their right flank against the base of the hill, was on the eastern side of the highway to Nagycsűr.<ref name=""Gyalókay14""/> The artillery was deployed near the highway, with the Cossacks on the left, near the Krummbach.<ref name=""Gyalókay15"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=76}}.</ref> The second battle line, in Pfersmann's report, was formed by the combined Austrian battalion led by Captain Count Heusenstamm.<ref name=""Gyalókay15""/> The defenders were thus developed to fight on the plain to the north of the city, at the bottom of the heights of Nagycsűr, with the Imperial troops to the east of the main road.<ref name=""Bánlaky""/>
[[File:Erdély panoráma - Jan Styka.jpg|940 px|thumb|Transylvanian Panorama depircting the Second Battle of Nagyszeben - Jan Styka]]
The Saxon National Guards remained in the town as a reserve, and defense force of the city<ref name=""Bánlaky""/> for the protection of which, as Pfersmann claimed in his report, all the measures were taken.<ref name=""Gyalókay15""/> The Saxon National Guard was united in the main square of the town and the castle cannons were provided with cannoneers.<ref name=""Gyalókay15""/> The ammunition stored in the warehouses was placed on the ammunition carts, just in case, and the war chest was sent towards the Vöröstorony Pass.<ref name=""Gyalókay15""/>

It was 4 o'clock in the afternoon when Bem's infantry, having reached the top of the Alter Berg Hill from Nagycsűr, caught sight of the enemy in battle formation.<ref name=""Gyalókay15""/>
[[File:Second Battle of Nagyszeben 11.03.1849. The situation between 4-5 p.m.png|left|200 px|thumb|Second Battle of Nagyszeben 11.03.1849. The situation between 4-5 p.m]]
Bem, who deployed his artillery on the high ground along the highway,<ref name=""Bánlaky""/>as usual, poured in a tremendous artillery barrage on the enemy troops positioned in front of the town. The Russian infantry withstood this relatively well,<ref name=""auto2""/>and for the moment his skirmish line between the vines has not faltered either. Skariatin sent his Cossacks to attack the Hungarian right flank, in order to bypass it from the rear,<ref name=""Gyalókay16"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=77}}.</ref> but the [[grapeshot]] of the Hungarian artillery put them in disorder, causing them to flee in panic.<ref name=""auto2""/> The Hungarian artillery inflicted so much damage on the Cossacks that they could not be used against the Hungarians in the rest of the battle.<ref name=""Bánlaky""/> Bem now ordered the center and right wing to advance<ref name=""Babucs""/> and pressed more and more infantry against the enemy's left flank, advancing on the slope of the Pfaffenbrunn hill, intending to bypass it.<ref name=""Gyalókay16""/> However, Skariatin saw what was happening and before the encirclement could take place, at 5 p.m., he retreated to a second position between Alten Berg and Nagyszeben.<ref name=""Gyalókay16""/> Bem's troops immediately descended from the hill, then the artillery duel started again.<ref name=""Gyalókay16""/> 
[[File:Second Battle of Nagyszeben 11.03.1849. The situation between 5-7 p.m.png|200 px|thumb|Second Battle of Nagyszeben 11.03.1849. The situation between 5-7 p.m]]
On Bem's orders, the Mátyás hussars attacked in the direction of [[Gușterița|Szenterzsébet]] (Hammersdorf), the Koburg and Wilhelm hussars led by Lieutenant-Colonel Kiss, attacked the left flank of the Russian army,<ref name=""Bánlaky""/>while the rookie Székely infantry, some of whom, because of the shortage of riffles, had only spears, launched a bayonet charge against the enemy's center.<ref name=""Bóna"">Bóna Gábor: [https://www.3szek.ro/load/cikk/78814/nagyszeben-bevetele-erdely-felszabaditasa-a-magyar-forradalom-es-szabadsagharc-harom-pillanata A magyar forradalom és szabadságharc három pillanata. Nagyszeben bevétele, Erdély felszabadítása] Háromszék. 2015. március 14., szombat</ref>

Seeing that both of his flanks were threatened by encirclement, as early as 6 a.m., Skariatin ordered the retreat to the entrenched suburbs.<ref name=""Gyalókay16""/>
[[File:Battle of Hermannstadt - sketched by Capt. Ed. Scheifele ; drawn on stone & lith by Schaerff & Bro. 71 Market Str. St. Louis. LCCN2006677461.tif|left|thumb|Battle of Hermannstadt - sketched by Capt. Ed. Scheifele]]
At the same time, Lieutenant-Colonel Sándor Kiss with the Coburg and Wilhelm Hussars attacked the Russian battery which was covering the retreat of the troops, and forced it to withdraw.<ref name=""Gyalókay17"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=78}}.</ref>

Major General [[Artur Nepokoychitsky]] describes the retreat of the Russian troops as follows: ''The retreat was carried out in exemplary order despite the persistent pursuit of the Hungarians. The infantry stopped several times and charged the enemy with bayonets. In the meantime, it had become so dark that the enemy's columns could no longer be seen, and even the line of attack was only indicated by rifle fire. It was feared that our columns, bravely repulsing the advancing enemy with their bayonets, would become so involved in the fight that the enemy would cut them off, so Colonel Skariatin himself led the bayonet charges, and did not allow our soldiers to venture too far.''<ref name=""Babucs""/>

The combined Austrian battalion led by Lieutenant General Pfersmann, apart from a few aimless movements behind the front line, had done nothing so far. Now, however, the 20th Company of the 51st Infantry Regiment occupied the barricaded eastern gate of the suburb, while the 19th Company, which was slightly behind, stood in reserve.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=77-78}}.</ref>

===The Siege===
The battle continued at the suburb's defenses, the Hungarians trying to enter the city. After an hour's fighting - at 7 pm - despite the Hungarian troops had taken the outlying houses, their attack had stalled there for the time being.<ref name=""Gyalókay17""/> The [[Royal Hungarian Honvéd|Honvéds]] were exhausted by the long march, followed by the battle, and the darkness prevented any orientation; and Gergely Bethlen's long-awaited detachment, which had arrived at Kiskapus only on the morning of the 11th, was nowhere to be seen.<ref name=""Gyalókay17""/> Hosszabb szünet állott be.<ref name=""Gyalókay17""/>
[[File:Siege of Nagyszeben - postcard from the Period of the Dualism.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|Siege of Nagyszeben - postcard from the Period of the Dualism]]
In the meantime, Bem's artillery was shelling the city.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hermann|2004|pp=194-195}}.</ref> Bem was about to postpone the siege until the next day, when the reserve brigade of about 850-1000 men and 4 guns, led by Colonel Gergely Bethlen, finally arrived,<ref name=""2013d"">{{Harvnb|Hermann|2013|pp=80}}.</ref> with a Székely battalion, the 11th Honvéd battalion and a [[Jäger]] [[squadron]].<ref name=""Bánlaky""/> ''Mr. Major, do you want to sleep in Nagyszeben today?'' asked Bem to the unit's commander, Olivér Bethlen. ''Yes, and my battalion has the same wish,'' Bethlen replied. ''Well, then, go on the attack with your battalion and stand up in the square,'' Bem said, as if nothing could be more normal.<ref name=""auto3"">{{Harvnb|Hermann|2004|pp=195}}.</ref>
[[File:Heinrich Gerhart - Die Schlacht bei Hermannstadt den 13ten März 1849 - Wien Museum Online Sammlung 88629 1-2.jpg|300 px|thumb|Heinrich Gerhart - Battle of Nagyszeben 11 March 1849 - Wien Museum Online Sammlung 88629 1-2]]
Bem immediately directed Bethlen's detachment to the left flank of the Hungarian army, and then ordered his troops to attack the outskirts.<ref name=""Gyalókay17""/> But here there was a near-fatal mix-up among the troops. For in the total darkness, it was impossible to distinguish friend from foe, and so it happened that some of the left wing's troops which remained behind blindly shot into Bethlen's battalions, which were ahead of them, thinking that they were enemy soldiers.<ref name=""Gyalókay17""/> Fortunately, Hussar Colonel Sándor Kiss, who recognized the danger that could result from this, somehow brought order and calm among the troops, by stopping the senseless shooting.<ref name=""Gyalókay17""/>

In the meantime, some houses in the suburbs had been set on fire by the Hungarian grenades, so due to this, now it was easier to see.<ref name=""Gyalókay17""/> But now the firelight also benefited the city's defenders by illuminating the attackers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=78-79}}.</ref> But this could not stop the assault troops, which had gained new momentum and were led by the 11th Honvéd Battalion. It was joined by the Máriássy Battalion, a Székely battalion, and part of the [[Debrecen]] Jägers.<ref name=""Gyalókay18"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=79}}.</ref> Soon the 4 companies of the 3rd Battalion of the 14th Border Guard Regiment, about 520-530 men, led by Major Károly Kabos, arrived and they also joined the attack.<ref name=""2013d""/>

The veteran soldiers of the 11th and the Máriássy battalions went on the attack, singing war songs and showing death-defying courage.<ref name=""Bóna""/> On two occasions, the attack was repulsed by the defenders' rifle fire, until finally a third time, which succeeded.<ref name=""Gyalókay18""/> Captain Miklós Szigeti, commander of the 11th (Kolozsvár) battalion, distinguished for their bravery shown in numerous earlier battles, with the red caps which they wore, wrote the following about their decisive attack: ''""Let's go, Hungarian! Long live the homeland!"" - rang out in the darkness painted red by flames, and with this cry the whole mass rushed forward with their bayonets, climbing the [[rampart]]s with incredible speed, breaking the main gate, mowing down the enemy gunners beside their guns (...) and all this happened as if by magic.''<ref name=""Babucs""/> Skariatin renounced to further defense of the suburbs, and evacuated them, retreating to the upper town.<ref name=""Gyalókay18""/> There, at the great barracks, at the outer end of the street towards Vöröstorony, he gathered his troops, joined also by the Austrian soldiers.<ref name=""Gyalókay18""/>
[[File:The capture of Nagyszeben in 11 March 1849 - György Gracza.jpg|left|300 px|thumb|The capture of Nagyszeben in 11 March 1849 - György Gracza]]
To the success of the Hungarian assault also contributed the fact that the stalemate of Bem's troops at 7 pm and the temporary cessation of the attacks led the defenders to wrongly believe, that the siege would continue the next day. It was precisely for this reason that the Saxon National Guard was dispersed and the city walls were not properly defended.<ref name=""Gyalókay18""/> The Saxon garrison in the walled inner city, which was destined to defend the main square, was sent home, allegedly on the news that Bem's 7 o'clock attack on the city had failed, without any provision being made for closing and guarding the gates.<ref name=""Gyalókay23""/>
[[File:Second Battle of Nagyszeben 11.03.1849. The situation between 7-12 p.m.png|200 px|thumb|Second Battle of Nagyszeben 11.03.1849. The situation between 7-12 p.m]]
Thus the Hungarians were able to enter the inner city through two gates without any resistance.<ref name=""Gyalókay18""/>

Major General Artur Nepokoychitsky describes the retreat as follows: ''The detachment, which had been hard pressed all the time, reached the gate towards Vízakna at 10 o'clock in the evening... Shortly afterward, flames broke out in several places in the suburbs, and even in our rear, on the other side of the town, on the road to Vöröstorony, which forced Colonel Skariatin to march quickly through the town towards ''[the city's entrance from the direction of]'' Vöröstorony. The commander of the detachment, after sending the artillery under the cover of ten infantry regiments, himself remained behind with a battalion in the rearguard, and engaged the advancing enemy, first at the city gate and then in pursuit ''[by the Hungarians]'' through the suburbs towards Vízakna, sometimes with bayonets and sometimes in hand-to-hand combat.''<ref name=""Babucs""/>

The retreat, in the narrow streets of the city, soon degenerated into a dangerous stampede.<ref name=""GyalókayII"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=85}}.</ref> The darkness, dispersed from time to time only by the flash of shells exploding here and there and the flames from burning houses, was not a source of encouragement. Skariatin's troops did not want to remain in the rear; this undesirable role was intended for the Austrian soldiers, whom the Russians, therefore, sought to bypass, even by force.<ref name=""GyalókayII""/> Only on the other side of the city was the order restored, but there was no question of either the Russians or the Austrians trying to resist there.<ref name=""GyalókayII""/>

==Aftermath==
On the following morning, the Russo-Austrian troops retreated as far as Nagytalmács, at the narrow entrance to the Vöröstorony Pass, and smaller Imperial detachments as far as Zóod and Talmacsel (today parts of the same city), where they remained, without being attacked, until 16 March.<ref name=""Bánlaky""/> Nagyszeben was in Bem's hands already between 9 and 10 p.m.<ref name=""Gyalókay18""/>

In terms of casualties, Bem's report seems completely unbelievable, as it indicates that only 5 soldiers of the Hungarian corps were killed and 35 wounded in the battle, which lasted more than 5 hours.<ref name=""Gyalókay19""/> Other sources put Hungarian casualties at 40 dead and 98 wounded, which may be closer to the truth.<ref name=""Gyalókay19""/> By their own account, the Russians had 99 dead and 104 wounded.<ref name=""Gyalókay19""/> The British Consul-General in [[Bucharest]] [[Robert Gilmour Colquhoun]] reports 97 dead, 150 wounded, and 154 missing Russians.<ref name=""Gyalókay19""/> The, probably smaller, losses of the Austrians and the Saxon National Guards are unknown.<ref name=""Gyalókay19""/>

The booty taken by the Hungarians was very considerable. According to the contemporary historian László Kővári, ''21 cannons, 1 million rifle cartridges, 6,000 cannonballs, 5,000 small guns ''(probably riffles)'', 150 [[hundredweight]] of gunpowder, large quantities of food and clothing, and among other things the cannon battery that the Hungarians lost at Vízakna. Lieutenant-Colonel B. Berger and Major Teichert, 14 officers, 115 enlisted men were taken prisoners; 850 sick ''[soldiers]'' were left behind in the hospitals, among them 123 wounded Russians.""<ref name=""Babucs""/>

Besides this, Nagyszeben was also the headquarters of the General-Commando, the Saxon movement, and of the Romanian National Committee, both hostiles to the Hungarian revolutionary government.<ref>Egyed Ákos: [http://varlap.hu/content/vkt_2013_4/vkt_2013_4_2_1.pdf Nagyszeben bevétele 1849. március 11-én] Várak, kastélyok, templomok. 9. évf. 4. sz. / 2013, pp. 14</ref> Therefore the documents left behind of all of these fell prey to the Hungarians.<ref name=""Babucs""/>

In addition to these, Hungarian men and women prisoners and hostages, who had been rounded up by the Austrians during the Austrian rule in Transylvania and held as prisoners in the monasteries and convents of the city, were also freed.<ref name=""Babucs""/>

The mayor of the town had previously offered a 3000 [[Hungarian forint|forint]] bounty on Bem's head, and now Bem went to him, offering himself for the reward: ''Well, Mr. Mayor, here I am, I brought myself here, I want the three thousand forints. The ''[frightened]'' mayor half-consciously paid the sum to the commander-in-chief, who then distributed the money among his soldiers.''<ref name=""Babucs""/> Nagyszeben did not get away that easily. It had to pay 100,000 silver forints for military uniforms, to provide 50 pairs of equipped horses, and to produce the following items of uniform: 3,600 [[Attila (clothing)|atillas]], 5,700 trousers, and the same number of pairs of boots, 6,000 hats, and 10,000 shirts and underpants.<ref name=""Babucs""/>

So the victory also had the character of avengement. For Bem for the defeat on 21 January, for the Hungarian army for the fall of the city that had joined forces with all the enemies of the Hungarian revolution, not only the Habsburg power but also Tsarist Russia.<ref name=""vkt"">Egyed Ákos: [http://varlap.hu/content/vkt_2013_4/vkt_2013_4_2_1.pdf Nagyszeben bevétele 1849. március 11-én] Várak, kastélyok, templomok. 9. évf. 4. sz. / 2013, pp. 15</ref>  Bem also reprimanded Nagyszeben for calling in the Russian troops, but, true to his well-known amnesty policy, he promised that the Hungarian government would ""cast a veil of oblivion over the past"".<ref name=""vkt""/>

Bem, in his appeal to the people of Nagyszeben, written on 12 March, pointed out that the support of the Austrian army, the call-up of the Russian army, and the propaganda spread from the city, which was defamatory of the Hungarians, containing slanders and untruths, and the ''understandable'' anger of the soldiers who finally took the city, led to some robberies and atrocities<ref name=""Egyed"">{{Harvnb|Egyed|2010|pp=369}}.</ref> (for example the killing by a hussar, ""in unknown circumstances"", of Joseph Benigni, the editor of the leading newspaper of Nagyszeben, the ''Siebenbürger Bote'', who consistently called Hungarians rebels and used derogatory terms against the Hungarian army)<ref name=""vkt""/> but from now on he forbids any further violence under the most severe penalty.<ref name=""Egyed""/>He also pointed out that during the previous battles, all the towns whose Saxon inhabitants, who, despite not having a positive view of the Hungarians but did not attack the Hungarian soldiers (Beszterce, Medgyes, Segesvár, [[Szászváros]]) were spared, and that the reason for the brief robberies in Nagyszeben, which lasted until his forceful intervention, was the justified anger of his soldiers at the invitation of the Russians.<ref name=""Egyed""/> The appeal also stated that the Hungarian army is fighting for the freedom not only of Hungarians but also of other nationalities living in the country and that this is shown by the fact that not only Hungarians but also a large number of nationalities of all languages and religions are fighting in its ranks.<ref name=""Egyed""/> ''You called for Russian help. This is a disgrace to the whole of Europe and a stamp of justice on our cause. This could not have been the wish of all the Transylvanian Saxons, who had been such [[Anti-Russian sentiment|Russophobes]] even a short time before. You can only clear yourselves of the accusation of this despicable act by publicly withdrawing it.''<ref name=""Egyed""/> Finally, he promises to ""cast a veil of oblivion over the past"" and to give the people of Nagyszeben the freedom to choose their officials, but they must accept the Union with Hungary, which he says meant a ''choice between the freedom and the [[knout]]'', and promise not to invite the Russians in again.<ref name=""Egyed""/> The Saxons in Nagyszeben have promised everything, including a formal protest against the Russian intervention.<ref name=""Egyed1""/>
[[File:The liberation of southern Traansylvania from the Austrian and Russian forces by the Hungarian army after the Battle of Nagyszeben from 11 March 1849.png|300 px|thumb|The liberation of southern Traansylvania from the Austrian and Russian forces by the Hungarian army after the Battle of Nagyszeben from 11 March 1849]]
Bem wanted to bring order and restore everyday life as quickly as possible, so he promised protection to all residents who were harmed, and he would bring the perpetrators of robbery or pillage to justice in a court-martial.<ref name=""vkt""/>

The new commander-in-chief of the city, Colonel Bánffy, appointed by Bem, promised, in the spirit of Bem, to protect the safety of persons and property, which he considered his main task, and asked the population that had fled to return to their homes in the city.<ref name=""vkt""/>

Before he moved out from Segesvár to Nagyszeben Bem had to expect the dangers which this bold action could bring. He had to anticipate three possible outcomes. The first was that Puchner would arrive before the assault on Nagyszeben; the second, that he would arrive during the battle; and the third, that he would arrive after the capture of the city..<ref name=""Gyalókay20"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=81}}.</ref> The first two possibilities, though unlikely, would have posed a threat to his armies, but in the end the third, the most likely, was the one that materialised.<ref name=""Gyalókay19""/>

Bem's plan of operations was based on the assumption that Puchner - either because he was late or because his fatigued troops needed rest - would not be able to intervene in time.<ref name=""Gyalókay19""/> He did not think that his opponent would be in Nagyszeben before him, nor did he expect even his arrival on the 12th, which is evident from the fact that seeing his attack losing its strength on the evening of the 11th, he was already thinking of postponing the capture of Nagyszeben until the next day.<ref name=""Gyalókay19""/>

Even if Bem had not succeeded in taking the city, his advance on Segesvár-Nagyszeben would still have had an important strategic result: to turn Puchner back towards Nagyszeben.<ref name=""Gyalókay21"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=82}}.</ref>

The main source of Bem's strength was Székely land, and as events have shown, he tried his best to keep the enemy away from this territory until the very end of the war.<ref name=""Gyalókay21""/> Puchner, on the other hand, relied on Königsboden (Királyföld), the region of [[Fogaras]], and the [[Barcaság]]. It was Königsboden he feared the most to lose.<ref name=""Gyalókay21""/> thus, the fact that Bem, who had slipped away from Segesvár, and was marching towards Nagyszeben, forced Puchner to turn on his heel and rush to the defense of his base of operations, which was now under imminent threat.<ref name=""Gyalókay21""/> In other words, the Austrian commander did what Bem forced him to do.<ref name=""Gyalókay22"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=83}}.</ref>

And since Bem had already driven the Austrians out of the [[Tihuța Pass|Borgó Pass]], after Puchner's return the enemy no longer threatened Székely land from either direction. In contrast, the Austrian corps had to march almost 200 kilometers from Medgyes to Segesvár and from there to Nagyszeben - and all this in vain.<ref name=""Gyalókay22""/> Twice as much as Bem, who started from Segesvár with rested troops, on a much better road than the Austrians.<ref name=""Gyalókay22""/> Puchner's army was therefore much more tired, and even if he would have scored a decisive victory against Bem on 11 March, due to the exhaustion of his troops, he would have been unable to launch a major offensive operation immediately after it, which could have end the war in his favor.<ref name=""Gyalókay22""/>

All the less so because Bem's army kept growing, while his army kept shrinking.<ref name=""Gyalókay22""/> Bem did not take with him the whole Transylvanian army under Nagyszeben, and thus only a part of it, in the worst case, could be destroyed in an eventual defeat, as happened earlier in the battle of Vízakna, and later at [[Battle of Segesvár|Segesvár]].<ref name=""Gyalókay22""/> However fatal a crushing defeat at Nagyszeben would have been for a part of the Transylvanian army of Bem, the fate of the campaign could not have been decided by this, but only by a successful attack on the rest of the Transylvanian army that followed immediately afterwards.<ref name=""Gyalókay22""/> Puchner, however, could not do such a thing, with his ever-dwindling army.<ref name=""Gyalókay22""/> It was only strong enough when it was in the immediate vicinity of Nagyszeben or [[Brassó]], where it could count on the support of the Russians who did not want to venture too far from those cities.<ref name=""Gyalókay22""/>

It should be mentioned that Austrian officers involved in the campaign attributed Bem's rapid success not only to Puchner's delay but also to the serious omissions made in the defense of Nagyszeben.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=83-84}}.</ref> According to them, the city would certainly have been defensible until the arrival of the relief corps.<ref name=""Gyalókay23"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=84}}.</ref> It also appears from the description of the eyewitness Captain Rästle that not everything was done to defend Nagyszeben.<ref name=""Gyalókay23""/>

At the time, when the attacking Hungarians were stalled for lack of reinforcements, there was just enough time to pack the city walls with soldiers.<ref name=""Gyalókay23""/> Indeed, it is hard to believe that Bem could so easily overpower Nagyszeben if the defenders did not stop fighting after the first success of Gergely Bethlen's attack.<ref name=""Gyalókay23""/> Every hour that the resistance was prolonged brought the relief corps closer, so that the struggle, which was so soon interrupted, did not seem hopeless.<ref name=""Gyalókay23""/>

However, Bem had no offensive intentions until the newly recruited battalions that came with him were armed and the situation was sufficiently clarified.<ref name=""GyalókayIII""/>

On 12 March, the bulk of Puchner's army which was following Bem, reached as far as Újegyház, his vanguard as far as Alzen. Puchner himself learned of the fall of Nagyszeben in Alzen.<ref name=""auto3""/> Ironically, Lieutenant General Puchner was appointed Field Marshal on 11 March, on the very same day his career as an army leader collapsed.<ref name=""Bóna""/>The news of the loss of Nagyszeben made him quite sick, so he handed over command to Major General József Kalliány. Kalliány's plan was to join forces with Skariatin to retake Nagyszeben.<ref name=""auto3""/> He therefore sent his troops to [[Felek]] and Fenyőfalva (today part of Felek) on the 13th.<ref name=""auto3""/>

Bem was right to fear that the Austrians would try to retake Nagyszeben. In his report on the battle to [[Lajos Kossuth]], Bem wrote that he feared that Puchner would try to retake the city. He was also aware that the Austrians still had a superior force in Transylvania.<ref name=""Egyed1"">{{Harvnb|Egyed|2010|pp=368}}.</ref>

On the night following the battle, Bem equipped his around 2,000 Szekler volunteers, who had until then only spears, with bayonet riffles and supplemented from among them the 11th Honvéd and the Máriássy battalions to 1360 soldiers.<ref name=""Bánlaky""/> In addition to this, he called to him the troops of Bánffy and Pereczy, who had been sent out earlier with about 4,000 men, the detachment of Major Herkalovics with the 32nd  and 50th Honvéd Battalions, whom he had sent to Kolozsvár, and a squadron of the 15th (Matthias) Hussar Regiment, formed in Kolozsvár,<ref name=""Bánlaky""/><ref name=""GyalókayIII""/> increasing his army to 14-15,000 men.<ref name=""auto3""/> On 12 March in the same afternoon, with his army, thus increased in size and reorganized, he then set up camp between Sibiu and [[Sellenberk]],<ref name=""GyalókayIII"">{{Harvnb|Gyalókay|1931|pp=86}}.</ref > Lieutenant-Colonel Károlyi occupied Vesztény (today part of Sellenberk) to prevent any attempt of Russian counterattack,<ref name=""GyalókayIII""/> and also sent Lieutenant-Colonel Bethlen with a small detachment to find the bulk of the Imperial Army under Puchner, via [[Dolmány]], Holcmány and Leschkirch (today both are parts of Újegyház), towards Erzsébetváros and Segesvár.<ref name=""Bánlaky""/>

According to Czetz, Bethlen wanted to fight with the approaching Austrian army, but according to Kalliány, some Hungarian prisoners of war said that he wanted to return to Székely land.<ref name=""GyalókayIII""/>

The total force at Kalliány's disposal was 8,000 soldiers, not counting the [[Gyulafehérvár]] garrison and the thousands of Romanian insurgents.<ref name=""auto3""/> Skariatin was at the Vöröstorony Strait with 4,200 men, and Engelhardt at Brassó with 4,800.<ref name=""auto3""/> So he had still a much stronger force than Bem's troops. But the Russians could only be counted on in defensive fighting.<ref name=""auto3""/>

Bem left 2,000 soldiers in Nagyszeben as a garrison,<ref>{{Harvnb|Egyed|2010|pp=369}}.</ref>  and then led a brigade under Colonel János Bánffy against Skariatin in the Vöröstorony Pass.<ref name=""auto3""/> János Czetz's brigade was given the task of occupying the bridge from Felek and cutting off the connection of the K.u.K. detachment there with Skariatin.<ref name=""auto3""/> On 15 March, this order was carried out. On that day, the Bánffy Brigade led by Bem attacked the Imperial troops defending the Vöröstorony Pass, which was the rearguard of the Russians, and drove them out of Transylvania.<ref name=""auto3""/>

By 16 March, the entire Russo-Austrian from the Vöröstorony pass was already camped south to the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] in Wallachia.<ref name=""auto3""/> On 16 March Czetz's brigade reached Fogaras. Kalliány regrouped his troops west of Brassó.<ref name=""auto3""/> Soon, however, he received a message from Major General Engelhardt, commander of the Russian troops in Brassó, telling him that if he was threatened by a force larger than his own, he would have to retreat to Wallachia.<ref name=""auto3""/> Kalliány then withdrew his troops to the immediate vicinity of Brassó, and decided to defend the city together with the Russians.<ref name=""auto3""/> However, when Engelhardt saw the exhausted, worn-out imperial troops, he announced that he would retreat to Wallachia, and demanded that Kalliány occupy the Tömös Strait with two brigades to ensure this. Kalliány complied with the request but weakened his main forces at [[Feketehalom]].<ref name=""auto3""/>

The next [[Battle of Feketehalom|battle took place there]] on 19 March.<ref name=""auto3""/> Czetz's artillery repulsed the attempts of the Imperial Infantry to attack, and after the reinforcements led by Bem broke the resistance of his left flank, the Imperial Army retreated to Brassó.<ref name=""auto3""/> During the pursuit, the imperial troops suffered heavy losses. On 20 March, the allies evacuated Brassó and retreated toward the Strait of Tömös. Bem occupied the city the same day and ordered the pursuit of the retreating troops.<ref name=""auto3""/>

On 21 March, the detachment of Lieutenant Colonel József Beke and Major Nándor Szabó caught up with the Imperial troops and made their retreat, already torturous in cold, snowy, and icy weather, even more difficult.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hermann|2004|pp=195-196}}.</ref> On the same day, Major August Heydte's detachment left Transylvania through the Törcsvár Strait.<ref name=""auto4"">{{Harvnb|Hermann|2004|pp=196}}.</ref>

After the occupation of Brassó, Bem returned to Nagyszeben because he had received news that Skariatin was trying to invade again.<ref name=""auto4""/> On 28 March, he attacked the Russian detachment stationed at the quarantine house in the Vöröstorony strait (a building used for the medical isolation of arrivals in case of customs and epidemic danger) and drove it to Wallachia.<ref name=""auto4""/> This meant that now almost all Transylvania - with the exception of the Austrian garrisons from the fortress of Gyulafehervár, the castle of [[Déva]], and the [[Apuseni Mountains|Érchegység]] Mountains in the hands of the Romanian insurrection - was in the hands of the Hungarian troops.<ref name=""auto4""/> For his triumphs Bem was awarded the First Class of the Hungarian Military Order of Merit and the rank of Lieutenant General.<ref name=""auto4""/>

The success was undoubtedly impressive, since Bem had achieved it while the opposing Austrian and Russian troops were outnumbering his troops.<ref name=""auto4""/> It is true, that the imperials could only count on the Russians in defensive battles, but Bem didn’t known this.<ref name=""auto4""/> With his lightning-quick moves he divided and [[Defeat in detail|defeated in detail]] the troops of Puchner, then Kalliány, and after his defeat at Medgyes, he completely turned the tide of the war in less than two weeks.<ref name=""auto4""/> At the same time, the imperial command completely lost its head, and although the troops fought with the tenacity expected of them, they could only ameliorate the disastrous consequences of the commanders' precipitated and contradictory decisions.<ref name=""auto4""/>

The '''Carron Bridge''' is a bridge over the River Carron near [[Ardgay]] in [[Sutherland]], Scotland.

==Description==
The Carron Bridge is located near the town of Ardgay in Sutherland, Scotland.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://her.highland.gov.uk/monument/MHG7424 |work=Highland Historic Environment Scotland |title=MHG7424 - Carron Bridge}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB7167 |work=Historic Environment Scotland |title=LB71674 - Carron Bridge over River Carron}}</ref>. It is a single span bridge of traditional stone construction. Notable are the placque on the east side outer wall, a cattle and walker tunnel on the bridge south side, nine distinctive metal repair stays, and the unusual supported footpath that runs around the base of the bridge on the north side.

==History==
The bridge was constructed in 1818. A placque in the outer wall at the middle of the bridge on the east side has a faint inscription which reads ""This bridge was erected by the Second District of Roads Ross-Shire 1818 Alex (illegible)"".

'''Joseph Ellison Adger Smyth''', known as '''E. A. Smyth''' (October 26, 1847 – August 3, 1942) was an American industrialist.

He was the son of [[Thomas Smyth (minister)|Thomas Smyth]], minister of [[Second Presbyterian Church (Charleston, South Carolina)|Second Presbyterian Church]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].

His gallant service in the [[Battle of Honey Hill]] earned him a promotion to [[sergeant]]. After the war he became a Captain in the Washington Artillery Rifle Club, and used that title for the rest of his life.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Moss |first1=Bill |title=Letters reveal a mysterious quirk |url=https://www.blueridgenow.com/story/news/2008/02/17/letters-reveal-a-mysterious-quirk/64608602007/ |access-date=1 May 2023 |work=[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|Times-News]] |date=15 February 2008}}</ref>

He started as a junior clerk in the hardware firm his grandfather, [[James Adger]], had established, but later decided to enter the textile industry. He joined forces with Francis J. Pelzer and served as president of the [[Pelzer Manufacturing Company]] in what is now [[Pelzer, South Carolina]] from 1880 to 1923. He was also president of Belton Mills from 1899 to 1920, and owned a controlling interest in ''[[The Greenville News]]'' from 1912 to 1923.<ref name=SCE>{{cite web |title=Smyth, Ellison Adger |url=https://www.scencyclopedia.org/sce/entries/smyth-ellison-adger/|website=[[South Carolina Encyclopedia]] |access-date=1 May 2023}}</ref>

On the platform [[Games@Mail.ru]] the critic rated the game 6.5 out of 10, noting that the tracks in the game are very short – ""Three turns, some kind of springboard, a place where the road surface changes – that's all. Thirty to forty seconds per race is probably the fastest race we've seen. And do not expect that there will be a lot of short tracks – if the authors of the [[Asphalt 9: Legends|Asphalt 9]] spent a lot of time working out different locations, in Rebel Racing the global map was simply divided into regions, in each of which you ride literally four or five repeating tracks. Yes, the complexity of the races is growing, sometimes you have to chase bosses, there are temporary events (in them, by the way, you can try out a car with a higher class) — and that's it. As a result, Rebel Racing quickly turns into a monotonous earning money in order to sometimes see something new. We passed all the races in a circle, improved the car, tried our hand at competing with the boss. It didn't work out — we repeat the procedure described above. A separate holiday comes when you manage to save up for a new car or move to another location.""<ref name="":0"" />

==Description==
Antenna usually with 8 [[Antenna (biology)#Structure|flagellomeres]], including a single-segment [[Antenna (biology)#Structure|clava]]; antennal [[Antenna (biology)#Structure|toruli]] (bases) are placed very low on the head in most species; mandibles usually with 2 or 3 teeth; all legs with 5 [[Arthropod leg|tarsomeres]]; protibial spur stout and curved. ''Eunotopsia'' differs from the other genera in having 11 flagellomeres including 3 clavomeres, toruli placed higher on the head, and having undivided mandibles. In the Spalangiinae the toruli are placed on lobes that overhang the clypeus and labrum. This distinctive antennal placement and the prognathous head (i.e. the head is held with the mouthparts projecting forwards) make it easy to place members of Spalangiinae.<ref name=BurksEtAl/>

In a review for ''[[All About Jazz]]'', John Sharpe wrote: ""the overwhelming impression is of two sympathetic partners having a ball... Schweizer lays down a playful rhythmic framework calling on older tropes such as ragtime and barrelhouse at times, which lends a cartoon air to proceedings. Wickihalder matches her every inch of the way, deploying a wide range of expressive tonal effects, but fully integrated into the flow rather than as technique for its own sake.""<ref name=""aaj"" />

Marcus O'Dair of ''[[Jazzwise]]'' called the album ""superb,"" and stated: ""The sense is of musicians with nothing to prove... working together to create bracing and beautiful chamber jazz.""<ref name=""jw"" />

''Point of Departure'''s Michael Rosenstein described the album as ""a strong one all around,"" noting the influence of both Monk and [[Steve Lacy (saxophonist)|Steve Lacy]] on the music, and commenting: ""this duo provides the ultimate homage by drawing on Lacy and Monk's vocabulary to create a personal sound all their own.""<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pointofdeparture.org/PoD49/PoD49MoreMoments4.html |title=Moment's Notice: Reviews of Recent Recordings |first=Michael |last=Rosenstein |website=Point of Departure |access-date=May 1, 2023}}</ref>

Writing for ''[[Cadence (magazine)|Cadence]]'', Bernie Koenig noted that ""the interplay between the two is excellent,"" and stated that Schweizer's playing is ""two handed but melodic, and she is always harmonically inventive.""<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Koenig |first=Bernie |date=April 2015 |title=CD Review: New Release |magazine=Cadence |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=149 |url=https://www.cadencejazzmagazine.com/membersonly/admin/assets/Irene%20Schw%20Spring.pdf}}</ref>

[[File:A Theory of ISIS.jpg|thumb|A Theory of ISIS book cover 2018]]

''A Theory of ISIS'' is a 2017 book by political historian [[Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Mohamedou]] which argues that the [[Islamic State]] constituted an original and hybrid form of political violence that merged post-colonialism, post-modernity, and post-globalisation thus impacting domestic, regional, and global politics and security.<ref>Chakravortty, Dipanwita (19 March 2020).

Highlighting the importance of periodization and spatialization in writing histories of political violence, the book argues that a layered “conceptual geology of IS” holds the key to its understanding, and is to be found in three different but related dimensions: first, a continuation of the earlier armed radical Islamist group [[Al-Qaeda|Al Qaeda]] and that group’s regional context; second, degenerated political developments in Iraq in the aftermath of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by the US and the [[Syrian civil war]] after 2011; and, third, the wider rise of a novel type of political violence linked to resurgent practices of the colonial era and military interventionism. The book concludes that the latter dimension constitutes the most important legacy of the group, and that such post-modern violence is more anchored in the Western metropolis than in the battlefields of [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], and [[Syria]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Blumi |first=Isa |date=2019-01-02 |title=A Theory of ISIS: Political Violence and The Transformation of the Global Order |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/21567689.2019.1568668 |journal=Politics, Religion & Ideology |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=136–138 |doi=10.1080/21567689.2019.1568668 |issn=2156-7689}}</ref><ref>1.  Koussa, Maryanne (28 December 2020).

The book is part of a trilogy by Mohamedou on the geopolitical implications of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], 2001 terrorist attacks, examining the events and their aftermath on international relations and transnational forms of political violence. The first volume, ''Contre-Croisade – Le 11 Septembre et le Retournement du Monde'' was published by L’Harmattan (Paris) in 2004 (under the title ''Contre-Croisade – Origines et Conséquences du 11 Septembre'') with an expanded edition in 2011.The second volume, ''Understanding Al Qaeda – The Transformation of War'' was published in 2007 by Pluto Press in the United Kingdom and the University of Michigan Press in the United States, with an expanded edition in 2011 under the title ''Understanding Al Qaeda – Changing War and Global Politics''.

The book examines the place the [[Islamic State]] occupies in contemporary international history and politics. It critiques the dominant existing literature on the group, and more generally on radical Islamism as lacking historical contextualization and historical conceptualization – specifically focus on the religiosity of the armed group, which Mohamedou calls “ornamental and theatrical”.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Otto |first=Mark |date=2019-03-13 |title=A Theory of ISIS with Mohammad-Mahmoud Ould Mohamedou |url=https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/a-theory-of-isis-with-mohammad-mahmoud-ould-mohamedou/ |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=The Dig |language=en-us}}</ref> In that regard, the book stands in contrast to works on the [[Islamic State]] and on [[Al-Qaeda]] by authors such as [[Gilles Kepel]], [[Lawrence Wright]], and [[Fawaz Gerges]], sharing more ground with the analyses of [[Mahmood Mamdani]], [[Faisal Devji]] and [[François Burgat]].

==Synopsis==
During the story conference, director Thop Nazareno explained that it's a reflection of a society wherein people are very image-conscious and exposed to social media, and what truly matters in the absence of it. 

While sir Deo Endrinal left a statement that makes everyone ponder, ""They are coming to an island broken, are they going to stay fractured or will they come out alive and healed?""<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 16, 2023 |title=They are coming to an island broken, are they going to stay fractured or... |url=https://twitter.com/DreamscapePH/status/1636217941770518528?t=MdbV4lHuwg8pc0PNiu2jcA&s=19 |website=DreamscapePH on Twitter}}</ref>

However, on 28 April 2023, FIBA announced during its Central Board meeting that the venue would be changed to the Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay, citing logistical and transport issues, which were experienced in various events at the arena, including various concerts and the [[2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualification (Asia)|sixth and final window of the 2023 World Cup Asian Qualifiers]].<ref name=""venuechange""/><ref>{{Cite web |title=FIBA Basketball World Cup 2023 final phase to be played at MOA Arena, Gilas to open campaign at Philippine Arena {{!}} SBP |url=http://sbp.ph/articles/fiba-basketball-world-cup-2023-final-phase-to-be-played-at-moa-arena-gilas-to-open-campaign-at-philippine-arena |access-date=28 April 2023 |website=sbp.ph}}</ref> Instead, the Philippine Arena will now only host the first two games of [[2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup Group A|Group A]]: Angola vs. Italy and Dominican Republic vs. Philippines.

'''''Enemies of the Enlightenment: The French Counter-Enlightenment and the Making of Modernity''''' is a book about the [[Counter-Enlightenment]], which challenged the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] at the end of the [[early modern period]].

The '''Chess World Cup 2023''' is a 206-player single-elimination chess tournament that will take place in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 30 July to 24 August 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Calendar |url=https://www.fide.com/calendar/53366 |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=www.fide.com |language=en}}</ref> It will be the 10th edition of the Chess World Cup.

In parallel with this open tournament, a [[Women's Chess World Cup 2023|women-only World Cup]] will be held.

== Format ==
The tournament was an 8-round knockout event, with the top 50 seeds given a bye directly into the second round. The losers of the two semi-finals played a match for third place.
The top three finalists will qualify for the [[Candidates Tournament 2024]], which will be a tournament to decide the next challenger for the World Championship.

Each round will consist of classical time limit games on the first two days, plus tie-breaks on the third day if required. The time limits were as follows:

* Two classical time limit games: 90 minutes, plus a 30-minute increment on move 40, plus a 30-second increment per move from move 1, per player.
* If the match is tied after the classical games, players will play two [[rapid chess]] games, with 25 minutes plus a 10-second increment per move, per player.
* If the match is still tied, players then will play two more [[rapid chess]] games, with 10 minutes plus a 10-second increment per move, per player.
* If the match is still tied, players then will play two [[Blitz chess|blitz games]], with 5 minutes plus a 3-second increment per move, per player.
* If the match is still tied, a single blitz game, with 3 minutes plus a 2-second increment per move, will be played to decide the match. A drawing of lots will determine which player plays white. If drawn, the players will switch colors and play again, until a decisive result was obtained.

=== Schedule ===
Each round will last three days: two for classical time limit games and a third, if necessary, for tie-breaks. Rounds 1 to 3 will run from July 30 to August 7; August 8 will be a rest day; Rounds 4 to 6 will run from August 9 to 17; August 18 will be a rest day; and the last two rounds will run from August 19 to 27.

'''ST-NXP Wireless''' was a joint venture made up of the wireless operations of [[STMicroelectronics]] and [[NXP Semiconductors]], existing between 2008 to 2009.

Formerly a division of the semiconductor firm [[Royal Philips Electronics]], NXP was established as an independent company in 2006. STMicroelectronics was formed in June 1987 by the merger of semiconductor companies SGS Microelettronica of Italy and Thomson Semiconductors, the semiconductor arm of France's Thomson.<ref>{{cite web

In April 2008, NXP and STMicroelectronics announced a merger of their wireless chip divisions, to create a joint-venture called ST-NXP Wireless.<ref>{{cite web |title=STMicro, NXP merge $3 bln wireless chip operations |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-stmicro-nxp-idUSL1079438120080410 |website=Reuters |access-date=14 April 2023 |language=en |date=10 April 2008}}</ref> The merger was intended to combine their wireless operations in 2G, 2.5G, 3G, multimedia, connectivity and future wireless technologies, with both businesses contributing significant portfolios of communication and multimedia patents.

In August 2008, another 50/50 joint-venture was formed between ST-NXP Wireless and [[Ericsson]], and in February 2009, STMicroelectronics purchased NXP's stake in the ST-NXP joint venture, resulting in the formation of [[ST-Ericsson]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shepard |first1=Jeff |title=Ericsson and ST Complete Deal To Create Joint Venture For Semiconductors & Platforms In Mobile Applications |url=https://eepower.com/news/ericsson-and-st-complete-deal-to-create-joint-venture-for-semiconductors-platforms-in-mobile-applications/# |website=EEPower |access-date=14 April 2023}}</ref>

The '''Château Charles''' was a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] palace in [[Tervuren]], [[Belgium]]. It was intended as summer retreat for prince [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]], governor of the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. However, it was soon demolished and nothing remains any more.

==History==
Tervuren was one of the main summer retreats of the Dukes of [[Duke of Brabant|Brabant]] and their successors, the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] dukes and the governors of the [[List of governors of the Habsburg Netherlands|Habsburg Netherlands]]. <ref name="":1""> {{cite journal  |last1=Duquenne |first1=Xavier |title=Le nouveau Château de Charles de Lorraine à tervuren |language=fr |work=Revue belge d’Archéologie en d’Histoire de l‘Art/ Belgisch Tijdschrift voor Oudheidkunde en Kunstgeschiedenis |publisher= L'Académie royale d'Archéologie de Belgique |year=2008 |pages=101-132 }} </ref><ref name="":2""> {{cite journal  |last1=Duquenne |first1=Xavier |title= Het Château Charles in de buurt van Tervuren |language=nl |work= Historische Woonsteden & Tuinen |publisher=Koninklijke Vereniging der Historische Woonsteden en Tuinen van België |year=2010 |pages=7-14 }} </ref> They primarily used the castle in Tervuren as a basis to hunt in the surrounding [[Sonian Forest]].<ref name="":1"" /><ref name="":2"" /> Although the castle was medieval in origin, it was modernized and redesigned over time up to the 18th century.<ref name="":1"" /><ref name="":2"" /> But as the moated palace became too damp, governor Charles of Lorraine decided to construct a new palace, the Château Charles. He commissioned [[Laurent-Benoît Dewez]] to design the new summer lodge.<ref name="":1"" /><ref name="":2"" /> When Dewez fell out of favour, [[Louis Montoyer]] and [[Antoine Payen the Elder|Antoine Payen]] completed the palace.<ref name="":1"" /><ref name="":2"" /> 

Construction started in 1778.<ref name="":1"" /><ref name="":2"" /> The main building was already completed in 1779, and furnishing followed soon.<ref name="":1"" /><ref name="":2"" /> With a great feast, the palace was put into use on 1 September 1779.<ref name="":1"" /><ref name="":2"" /> It was barely finished when Charles of Lorraine passed away in 1780.<ref name="":1"" /><ref name="":2"" /> His nephew, emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] first intended to sell the country house, but ultimately he made decision to demolish Château Charles as well as the Tervuren castle to recycle its building materials to pay for the debts Charles of Lorraine had left.<ref name="":1"" /><ref name="":2"" /> Charles successors as governors, [[Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen|Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria]] and her husband [[Albert Casimir, Duke of Teschen|Prince Albrecht of Saxony-Teschen]] commissioned a new palace in [[Palace of Laeken|Laeken]], which was constructed between 1782 and 1784.<ref name="":1"" /><ref name="":2"" />

'''Erika Cuéllar Soto''' (born in [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], 1978), is a Bolivian biologist recognized as the guardian of the [[Gran Chaco]] region of South America, where she has worked to promote and conserve this ecosystem that covers regions of Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil. A fundamental axis of her activism is the training of local community members in the conservation of their territory as well as the training of parabiologists to be guardians of nature.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Erika Cuéllar |url=https://explorer-directory.nationalgeographic.org/erika-cuellar |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=explorer-directory.nationalgeographic.org}}</ref> She has been named a National Geographic explorer.<ref name="":1"">{{Cite web |date=2019-11-20 |title=Erika Cuéllar, la exploradora boliviana de Nat Geo |url=https://eldeber.com.bo/edicion-impresa/erika-cuellar-la-exploradora-boliviana-de-nat-geo_157204 |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=El Deber |language=es-ES}}</ref>

== Life and work ==
Cuéllar graduated in biology from the [[Gabriel René Moreno Autonomous University]] and then obtained a master's degree in [[Biodiversity]] Conservation from the [[University of Kent]] in England. She earned a PhD in [[Zoology]] at the [[University of Oxford]].<ref name="":1"" /><ref name="":0"">{{Cite web |last=Bacanas |date=2022-01-17 |title=Mujeres Bacanas {{!}} Erika Cuéllar (1978) |url=http://mujeresbacanas.com/erika-cuellar-1978/ |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=Mujeres Bacanas |language=es-CL}}</ref> 
[[File:Guanaco de San Carlos.jpg|thumb|[[Guanaco]], the wild ancestor of the llama.]]
Cuéllar's work focuses mainly on the conservation and sustainable protection of the Gran Chaco, she is coordinator of the Species Survival Committee of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].  A fundamental part of her work consists of training parabiologists, that is, making communities and the local population participate in caring for their environment through comprehensive training so that they can be researchers and custodians of natural resources. In this regard, she has said: “I would like the local people, who know so much about nature, because they were born and lived in it, to stop being (considered) simply cheap labor.”<ref>{{Cite web |title=Érika Cuéllar |url=https://www.la-razon.com/escape/2012/08/19/erika-cuellar/ |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=La Razón |language=en}}</ref>
[[File:Sekeetamys calurus.JPG|thumb|Bushy-tailed Jird (Sekeetamys calurus), adult male]]
She has worked prominently for the protection of juvenile and adult [[Guanaco|guanacos]]. Thanks to Cuéllar's efforts, their hunting has become prohibited, the repopulation of genetically isolated herds is being explored and attempts are being made to recover their habitat, which had been invaded by free-range cattle and invasive plants.<ref name="":0"" /> According to Arrazola, Cuéllar's impact continues,<blockquote>Erika Cuéllar's innovative solutions and great passion bring new hope to wildlife. She trains villagers in the Gran Chaco to be practical conservation managers and parabiologists. Communities nominate participants for the 800-hour course that ranges from basic biology, mathematics, and other sciences to map production, computer and GPS use, research project design, data collection, and presentation of results. Those who pass the final exam take their professional skills to the forests, wetlands and rangelands. They make bird and mammal census reports, display and analyze data from cameras and radio tracking devices.<ref name="":2"">{{Cite web |last=Arrazola |first=Elizabeth |date=2019-05-26 |title=Erika Cuéllar: “La gente tiene el poder de cambiar el rumbo del medioambiente” |url=https://www.lostiempos.com/oh/entrevista/20190527/erika-cuellar-gente-tiene-poder-cambiar-rumbo-del-medioambiente |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=Los Tiempos |language=es}}</ref></blockquote>In 2016, Cuéllar was part of the team that made the first recorded sightings of the [[Bushy-tailed jird|Sekeetamys calurus]] rodent (Bushy-tailed Jird) in the territory of southern [[Oman]], in western Asia.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cuéllar Soto |first=Érika |last2=Pardiñas |first2=Ulises Francisco J. |date=2016-08-18 |title=First record of the bushy-tailed jird, Sekeetamys calurus (Thomas, 1892) (Rodentia: Muridae) in Oman |url=https://ri.conicet.gov.ar/handle/11336/36683 |doi=10.1515/mammalia-2015-0141 |issn=0025-1461}}</ref>

==Release==
===Reception===
[[AllMovie]] stated that ""The real gem here, though, is ""Scream House"" [Dreamhouse], a truly unsettling tale that unfolds at a perfectly creepy pace and boasts a simple but surprising twist ending."" But felt ""the American sequences that glue the three stories together could have been tossed off in an afternoon, but they do offer some entirely unnecessary nudity and boneheaded Brooklynese that should amuse slumming horror fans who give ''Screamtime'' a chance.<ref name=AllMovie/>

===Home video===
The film was originally released on [[VHS]] in 1985 by Lightning Video in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vhscollector.com/movie/screamtime |title=Screamtime |website=VHSCollector |accessdate=May 1, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025235716/http://vhscollector.com/movie/screamtime |archive-date=October 25, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> As of 2023, it has yet to be released on [[DVD]] or [[Blu-ray]].

'''Thomas Douglas Stimson''' (1828-1898) was an American entrepreneur and businessman who played a significant role in the [[timber industry]] of the [[Pacific Northwest]]. He is best known as the founder and owner of the [[Stimson Lumber Company]], which became one of the largest and most successful lumber companies in the region.

== Early Life and Career ==
Stimson was born around 1828.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Thomas Douglas Stimson I |url=https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/KL87-L6X |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=www.familysearch.org}}</ref> He left his childhood home in New York at the age of fourteen<ref name="":0"">{{Cite web |title=No. 212 - Stimson Residence |url=http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2009/02/no-212-stimson-residence.html |access-date=2023-05-01}}</ref> He started his career in the lumber industry working a logging claim in Michigan in the 1850s.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Stimson Lumber Company Inc. {{!}} Encyclopedia.com |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/books/politics-and-business-magazines/stimson-lumber-company-inc |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Thomas Douglas Stimson (1828-1898) - Find a Grave... |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/6718989/thomas-douglas-stimson |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=www.findagrave.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=PCAD - Stimson, Thomas Douglas and Achsah J.

He then moved his family to Chicago for a number of years before eventually retiring to Los Angeles in 1890.<ref name="":0"" />

== Stimson Lumber Company ==

In 1873, Stimson founded the Stimson Clark Manufacturing Company. This would later become the Stimson Mill Company, and eventually would be incorporated into the Stimson Lumber Company. This became one of the most prominent lumber companies in the Pacific Northwest. The company specialized in the production of high-quality lumber and timber products, which were in high demand as the region experienced rapid growth and development.

Under Stimson's leadership, the company grew rapidly and expanded its operations throughout the region. By the late 1880s, the Stimson Lumber Company had become one of the largest employers in the Pacific Northwest, with several sawmills, logging camps, and other facilities throughout the region.

== Legacy ==
Stimson's contributions to the timber industry of the Pacific Northwest were significant and long-lasting. His company played a major role in the economic development of the region and helped to establish the timber industry as one of the key sectors of the regional economy.

Today, the Stimson Lumber Company is still in operation, and it remains one of the largest and most successful lumber companies in the Pacific Northwest. Stimson's legacy as an entrepreneur and business leader continues to be celebrated by historians and industry experts alike, and his contributions to the region's economy and history are still remembered and honored to this day.

'''''A French Novel''''' ({{lang-fr|Un roman français}}) is a 2009 novel by the French writer [[Frédéric Beigbeder]]. It was awarded the [[Prix Renaudot]].

==Plot==
An [[autobiographical novel]], the starting point of ''A French Novel'' is an incident on 28 January 2008, when [[Frédéric Beigbeder]] was arrested for snorting [[cocaine]] outside a nightclub in Paris. As he is incarcerated by the police for two days, he reflects on his childhood, his grandfather, the divorce of his parents, the characters of his father and brother, his early infatuations, and the France of the 1960s and 1970s he grew up in.

==Reception==
''A French Novel'' received the [[Prix Renaudot]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rousseau |first=Christine |date=2 November 2009 |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/livres/article/2009/11/02/le-prix-renaudot-attribue-a-frederic-beigbeder_1261564_3260.html |title=Le prix Renaudot attribué à Frédéric Beigbeder |language=fr |newspaper=[[Le Monde]] |access-date=1 May 2023 }}</ref>

[[Sylvia Brownrigg]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said the book is amusing and Beigbeder entertains the reader with a mix of highbrow and lowbrow cultural references, including [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], [[foie gras]], [[Jack Bauer]], ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' and [[Carambar]], and walks ""a fine line between self-pity and self-awareness"".<ref>{{cite news |last=Brownrigg |first=Sylvia |author-link=Sylvia Brownrigg |date=14 September 2013 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/14/french-novel-frederic-beigbeder-review |title=A French Novel by Frédéric Beigbeder – review |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=1 May 2023 }}</ref> Ivan Juritz of ''[[The Independent]]'' called it ""striking in its lack of bravado"" and said it can be read as a commentary on Beigbeder's other novels.<ref>{{cite news |last=Juritz |first=Ivan |date=17 August 2013 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/review-a-french-novel-by-frederic-beigbeder-8772472.html |title=Review: A French Novel, By Frédéric Beigbeder |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date=1 May 2023 }}</ref>

The '''Corn Exchange''' is a commercial building on Fore Street in [[Hertford]], [[Hertfordshire]], England. The building, which is currently used as an events venue, is a Grade II [[listed building]].<ref name=listed>{{NHLE|num= 1268936 |desc= Former Corn Exchange and Public Hall |access-date=1 May 2023}}</ref>

==History==
The site currently occupied by the corn exchange on the north side of Fore Street originally accommodated a gaol which dated from around 1702 and which had been demolished in 1777 to make way for a butchers' market.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.hertford.net/history/gaol.php  |title= Hertford's Gaol|publisher=Discover Hertford| access-date=1 May 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.ourhertfordandware.org.uk/content/places/hertford-places/social-issues-hertford-places/daring-escape-hertford-gaol |title=Daring Escape from Hertford Gaol|first=S. |last=Williams|publisher=Hertfordshire County Council| access-date=1 May 2023}}</ref> Corn merchants traded in corn behind the [[Shire Hall, Hertford|Shire Hall]] until the first purpose-built corn exchange was erected immediately to the west of the Cross Keys Inn on Fore Street in the 1840s.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.hertford.net/history/timeline.php  |title=Timeline|publisher=Discover Hertford| access-date=1 May 2023}}</ref> 

In the mid-19th century, civic leaders decided that the original structure was inadequate and should be replaced with a new structure. The new building was designed by [[William Hill (architect)|William Hill]] of [[Leeds]] in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]], built in [[ashlar]] stone and was completed in 1859. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage of three bays facing onto Fore Street. On the ground floor, the central bay contained a panelled doorway while the outer bays contained tri-partite windows where the parts were separated by [[Anta (architecture)|antae]]. The first floor was fenestrated by three round headed windows with [[architrave]]s and [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]]s, each with an inner window, where the parts were also separated by antae. The bays were flanked by [[Corinthian order]] [[pilaster]]s which supported an [[entablature]] and a [[pediment]]. The entablature was inscribed with the words ""Corn Exchange and Public Hall"", while the pediment containing a circular panel bearing a carving of a [[Hart (deer)|hart]] in the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]]. Internally, the principal room was the main hall which was intended to serve as a library when not in use for corn trading.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rZtj_1BojzYC&pg=RA1-PA248   |title=The British Almanac of the Society for the Diffusion of Natural Knowledge|year=1859  |page=248}}</ref> The architectural historian, [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], described the design as ""like that of an ambitious methodist chapel"".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v9nm4_WewXQC&pg=PA186   |title=Hertfordshire (Buildings of England Series)|first1= Nikolaus|last1= Pevsner|first2=Bridget|last2= Cherry|year=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0300096118 |page=186}}</ref> 

In August 1914, at the start of the [[World War I|First World War]], recruits for the [[Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment|4th (Militia) battalion, The Bedfordshire Regiment]] were billeted in the building.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.ourhertfordandware.org.uk/content/places/hertford-places/hertford-through-time/hertford_in_1914/hertford_in_august_1914  |title=Hertford in August 1914|first1= Geoffrey|last1= Cordingley |first2= Jennifer|last2= Ayto|publisher=Hertfordshire County Council| access-date=1 May 2023}}</ref> At the apex of the pediment there was originally a statue of the Roman goddess of agriculture, [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], but this was removed during the [[World War II|Second World War]] to prevent it causing injury to passers-by during German bombing.<ref name=listed/>

The use of the building as a corn exchange declined significantly in the wake of the [[Great Depression of British Agriculture]] in the late 19th century.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=obn5AQAAQBAJ|first=T.

'''Lucy Helen Yates''' (1863 – 1935) was a British suffragist and writer on cookery and finance. She left the Pankhursts' [[Women's Social and Political Union]] (WSPU) to join the [[Women's Freedom League]].

== Life ==
Yates was born in [[Basford, Nottingham|Basford]] near Nottingham in 1863. Some of her early writing was for the [[Girl's Own Paper]].<ref name=""perse"">{{Cite web |title=Lucy H Yates |url=https://persephonebooks.co.uk/pages/lucy-h-yates |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=Persephone Books}}</ref> She started in 1892 writing about cookery.<ref name=""girlsown"">{{Cite web |title=The Girl's Own Paper Index |url=https://www.lutterworth.com/gop/non-fiction-authors/lucy-helen-yates/sort/https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lutterworth.com%2Fgop%2Fnon-fiction-authors%2Flucy-helen-yates%2Fsort%2Fva |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=The Girl's Own Paper Index |language=en}}</ref>

Her first book ''The Profession of Cookery from a French Point of View'' was about cookery and so was her second. In 1903 she turned to finance in 1903 writing a book for businesswomen titled   ''Management of Money A Handbook of Finance for Women''. 

In November 1907 she joined the mass exodus from the WSPU to join the Women's Freedom League and as a writer it was her job to explain the difference between the two organisations. She wrote that the WFL was democratic and they did not interupt cabinet ministers as the WSPU were known to do. She was an assistant organising secretary of the WFL and she write articles for the WFL's paper ""The Vote"".<ref name=""simkin"">{{Cite web |title=Lucy H. Yates |url=https://spartacus-educational.com/Lucy_Yates.htm |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=Spartacus Educational |language=en}}</ref>

In 1911 she was working for the [[Daily Mail]] and she did make a census return<ref name=""simkin""/> (when some suffragists refused to cooperate).

She also gave talks at WFL events talking about finance at [[Caxton Hall]]. She noted how money was frequently put out of the reach of women. She believed that ""the Suffrage movement has developed in women a true appreciation of the importance of the financial side of their Cause, and the desire to get the best possible result from the contents of their war chest"".<ref name=""simkin"" />

She returned to cookery writing in 1912 with  ''In Camp and Kitchen: A Handy Guide for Emigrants and Settlers''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=In camp and kitchen : a handy guide for emigrants and settlers / by the author of ""The successful home cook,"" etc. |url=https://wellcomecollection.org/works/wugshz84 |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=Wellcome Collection |language=en}}</ref> 

She continued to write for Girls Own Paper on cookery, finance and fiction.<ref name=""girlsown""/> In 1929, the year after women gained the vote in Britain, she wrote a series of stories about ""Margaret"" in ''Girls Own'' titled, ''Margaret's Adventures in Search of a Career; Margaret Turns Pathfinder; Margaret Launches a Canteen; Margaret Becomes a Co Partner'' and ''Margaret as the People's Representative''.<ref name=""girlsown""/>

Her last publication was in 1934 and it was a cookery book that also included wider advice on growing the produce. It was illustrated by Mary Gardiner and titled ''The Country Housewife’s Book'' or ''How to Make the Most of Country Produce and Country Fare''.<ref name=buk34>{{Cite web |title=The Country Housewife’s Book |url=https://persephonebooks.co.uk/products/the-country-housewife-s-book |access-date=2023-05-01 |website=Persephone Books}}</ref> Yates died in 1935.<ref name=""perse""/>

73699476,Opinion_polling_for_the_2007_Greek_legislative_election,"In the run up to the [[2007 Greek legislative election]], various organizations carried out [[opinion polling]] to gauge voting intention in [[Greece]] during the term of the [[List of members of the Hellenic Parliament, 2004–2007|12th]] [[Hellenic Parliament]]. Results of such polls are displayed in this article. The date range for these opinion polls is from the [[2004 Greek legislative election|previous legislative election]], held on 7 March 2004, to the day the next election was held, on 16 September 2007.

Polls are listed in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first and using the dates when the survey fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The ""Lead"" columns on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll.

==Voting intention estimates==
===Polling===
The table below lists nationwide voting intention estimates. Refusals are generally excluded from the party vote percentages, while question wording and the treatment of ""don't know"" responses and those not intending to vote may vary between polling organisations. Polls that show their results without disregarding those respondents who were undecided or said they would abstain from voting (either physically or by voting blank) have been re-calculated by disregarding these numbers from the totals offered through a [[WP:CALC|simple]] [[Rule of three (mathematics)|rule of three]] in order to obtain results comparable to other polls and the official election results. When available, seat projections are displayed below the percentages in a smaller font. 151 seats are required for an [[absolute majority]] in the [[Hellenic Parliament]].<ref>[http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=5347&subid=2&pubid=132809 Exit poll results] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929105117/http://www.ethnos.gr/article.asp?catid=5347&subid=2&pubid=132809 |date=2007-09-29 }} from the [http://www.ethnos.gr Ethnos] daily newspaper</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eklogesonline.com/portal/polls/2007.asp?state=polls|title=Opinion polling - Legislative election 2007 - by chronological order|website=eklogesonline.com}}</ref>

[[File:Trumpan_Church,_Waternish_Peninsula,_Isle_of_Skye,_Highland_-_geograph.org.uk_-_2028988.jpg|thumb|Trumpan church, Skye]]

'''Trumpan Church''' is a ruined medieval church located on the [[Isle of Skye]] in [[Scotland]]. In 1578, the church was the site of a brutal massacre of the [[Clan MacLeod]] by [[Clanranald|Clan Macdonald]], (also known as Clan Ranald) of [[South Uist]]. The attack was in retaliation for the massacre of hundreds of members of Clan Macdonald in the village of [[Eigg]] the previous year. The church and village of Trumpan were abandoned after the attack. The roofless church and surrounding graveyard contain  late medieval carved gravestones. [[Historic Environment Scotland]] designated the church and surrounding burial ground a [[scheduled monument]] in 1936.
==Description==
Situated on the northern end of the [[Waternish|Waternish peninsula]] on the Isle of Skye, is the 13th century ruined village church of [[Trumpan]].<ref name=""Britain Express"">{{cite web |title=Trumpan Church |url=https://www.britainexpress.com/attractions.htm?attraction=725 |website=Britain Express |access-date=12 March 2023}}</ref> Also known as ""Cille Conain"", the building dates from the medieval era and was in use until the 16th century.<ref name=""Canmore"">{{cite web |title=Skye, Trumpan Church |url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/10939/skye-trumpan-church |website=Canmore: National Record of the Historic Environment |access-date=12 March 2023}}</ref>
[[File:Skye_Trumpan_Churchyard_Aerial.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Trumpan churchyard]]
The layout of the church is rectangular, measuring {{convert|15.2|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|7|m|abbr=on}} wide. The structure's north wall with arched doorway and east gable have survived undamaged. The north wall is {{convert|2.75|m|abbr=on}} in height, while little remains of the south wall. Inside the church are late medieval gravestones and the remnants of a stone basin that is believed to be the holy water font. One of the graves is inscribed with a [[claymore]] (sword) surrounded by animals and foliage.<ref name=""Britain Express"" /><ref name=""Canmore"" /><ref name=""HE church"" /> 

The burial ground surrounding the church contains a rough standing stone, {{convert|1.3|m|abbr=on}} in height, and known as the ""Priest's Stone"". A second medieval grave slab, southwest of the church, is engraved with the image of a tonsured priest with the placement of the hands  as if in prayer. In the upper part of the stone, is an interlaced  cross within a circle, and in the lower part of the stone is the image of a chalice. The church and surrounding burial ground were designated a scheduled monument in 1936.<ref name=""HE church"" />

==History==
Trumpan church dates from the medieval era, possibly the 13th century. It is believed to have been dedicated to St Connan. It is the site of the mid-16th century massacre of Clan Macleod by Clan Macdonald of South Uist. The Macdonald party landed on the island on a Sunday morning in May, 1578 and set fire to the church and prevented the villagers inside from escaping. The massacre was in retaliation for the slaughter of over 350 members of Clan Macdonald on the island of [[Eigg]] the previous year <ref name=""Britain Express"" /><ref name=""HE church"" /> <ref name=""Undiscovered Scotland"">{{cite web |title=Trumpan Church |url=https://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/skye/trumpanchurch/index.html |website=Undiscovered Scotland |access-date=12 March 2023}}</ref>

A battle ensued when MacLeod clan members from Dunvegan rushed to the scene and attacked the murderers as they sought to leave the island and were stopped by a receding tide. Very few of the Macdonald clan survived the battle.<ref name=""Britain Express"" /> 
The victims were buried near a [[dyke (embankment)|dyke]] which was pulled down over the corpses, giving the name to the battle as the ""[[Battle of the Spoiling Dyke]]"". The church and village were abandoned after the massacre.<ref name=""Canmore"" />

The church's burial ground is also thought to be where [[Rachel Chiesley, Lady Grange|Lady Grange]], a famous 18th century kidnap victim, is buried.<ref name=""HE church"">{{cite web |title=Trumpan Church, burial ground and 'Priest's Stone', Hallin |url=https://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/SM949 |website=Historic Environment Scotland |access-date=12 March 2023}}</ref>

'''''Legendrea loyezae''''' is a rare species of [[freshwater]] [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[ciliate]]. Only six accounts of ''L. loyezae'' specimens have been published as of 2022.<ref name=""Legendrea"">{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.protis.2022.125912 | title=The Extraordinarily Rare Ciliate Legendrea loyezae Fauré-Fremiet, 1908 (Haptoria, Ciliophora) | year=2022 | last1=Weiss | first1=James | last2=Andreou | first2=Demetra | last3=Esteban | first3=Genoveva F. | journal=Protist | volume=173 | issue=6 | page=125912 | pmid=36242851 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Taxonomy==
[[Phylogenetic analysis]] of a partial ''L. loyezae'' [[18S ribosomal RNA]] sequence indicate it is a member of the Family [[Spathidiidae]] and Order [[Haptorida]]. It is also more closely related to the species ''[[Apertospathula oktemae]]'' of the family Apertospathulidae and ''[[Arcuospathidium]]'' sp. than other Spathidiidae. The sequence is also a [[sister group]] to a clade of three ''[[Epispathidium]]'' sequences.<ref name=""Legendrea"" />

==Description==
''L. loyezae'' are unicellular organisms {{convert|75|–|120|µm|in}} long and {{convert|40|–|55|µm|in}} wide, and are [[ovoid]] and slightly flattened in shape. It has uniform [[cilia]] on its body and a complete [[oral bulge]] (bulge located at its [[Cytostome|mouth]]) with dense rows of [[extrusome]]s. It possesses one elongated, horseshoe-shaped [[macronucleus]] and a [[contractile vacuole]] at its posterior end.<ref name=""Legendrea"" />

''L. loyezae'' possesses 15–30 tentacles protruding from an indentation in its posterior, with 5–8 cilia in a ring and densely-packed, curved, needle-shaped extrusomes protruding from a vacuole on each tentacle tip. When swimming, these tentacles retract and trail behind the cell, which is heart-shaped due to the indentation; when stationary, the cell flattens against a surface such that it takes on a rounder shape and the tentacles fully extend, becoming narrower and reaching up to twice the length of the body. The vacuole also expands when the tentacles extend.<ref name=""Legendrea"" />

==Habitat and distribution==
''L. loyezae'' occurs in freshwater [[anoxic]] (oxygen-free) sediments, such as that found in freshwater ponds.<ref name=""Legendrea"" /> Fauré-Fremiet's first account of their existence states they were first found in a pond near Paris, France.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fauré-Fremiet |first1=Emmanuel |author1-link=Emmanuel Fauré-Fremiet |date=June 1908 |title=Sur deux Infusoires nouveaux de la famille des Trachelidae |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/18804#page/48/mode/1up |journal=Revue Suisse de Biologie |volume=33 |issue= |pages=13–16 |doi= |doi-access= |language=fr}}</ref> In the second account of their existence, published by [[Eugene Penard]], they were discovered in a marsh in [[Rouelbeau, Geneva]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Penard |first1=Eugene |author1-link=Eugene Penard |date=June 1914 |title=Un curieux Infusoire ''Legendrea bellerophon'' |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/36673 |journal=Revue Suisse de Biologie |volume=22 |issue=13 |pages=407–432 |doi=10.5962/bhl.part.36673 |doi-access=free |language=fr}}</ref> In 2014, specimens were found in freshwater ponds in Germany. In 2021 and 2022, specimens were found in woodland freshwater lakes in [[Warsaw, Poland]].<ref name=""Legendrea"" />

==Behavior==
===Feeding phase===
When feeding, ''L. loyezae'' assumes its stationary form for days at a time to wait for prey. The cilia at the tip of the extended tentacles perform a ""beating"" motion, while the tip with extrusomes moved like ""fish bait"". In their 2022 article, Weiss et al. theorized that the tentacles capture prey in the extrusomes, then move it to the cytostome (mouth) to be ingested.<ref name=""Legendrea"" />

===Movement===
During the feeding phase, ''L. loyezae'' were observed as not reacting to tapping or short bursts of UV light on the microscope slides they were residing on. However, it did move in response to the nearby presence of ''[[Monomorphina]]'' sp., a [[photosynthetic]] organism, likely in reaction to its production of oxygen. In such an event, ''L. loyezae'' can contract its tentacles in about 30 seconds, changing from its stationary form to its swimming form as it moves to an anoxic location where it may resume its feeding phase.<ref name=""Legendrea"" />

===Ecology===
''L. loyezae'' is a free-living, non-parasitic organism. [[Endosymbiotic]] [[prokaryote]]s are present inside its [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=""Legendrea"" />

== Synopsis ==
A down-on-his-luck [[mariachi]] group gets the call of a lifetime when they are named finalists in a national contest for the best mariachi band in [[Mexico]].

""'''Vita spericolata'''"" (transl. ""Reckless life"") is a 1983 song composed by [[Vasco Rossi]] (lyrics) and  {{Interlanguage link|Tullio Ferro|it}} (music) and performed by Vasco Rossi.

==Background==
The song had a gestation of about an year; it was initially presented by composer Ferro with English lyrics,<ref name=""Rizzoli"" /> and in an early draft it was a love song about a girl named Licia.<ref name=music/> Eventually, Rossi chose to reprise the same theme already explored in previous singles ""Siamo solo noi"" and ""Vado al massimo"", namely a celebration of [[anticonformism]] and of freedom from all schemes and conventions.<ref name=""Rizzoli"" />

The song premiered at the [[Sanremo Music Festival 1983|33rd edition]] of the [[Sanremo Music Festival]], where it ranked penultimate.<ref name=""Rizzoli"" /><ref name=music>{{cite book|last=Anselmi, Eddy |title=Festival di Sanremo: almanacco illustrato della canzone italiana|chapter=Vita spericolata|publisher=[[Panini Comics]] |date=2009|isbn=978-8863462296|pages=339}}</ref> It eventually turned out to be a long-selling hit and Rossi's consacration.<ref name=Rizzoli>{{cite book|author=Ezio Guaitamacchi|title=1000 canzoni che ci hanno cambiato la vita|publisher=[[Rizzoli Libri|Rizzoli]]|year=2009|isbn=978-8858617427|chapter=Vita spericolata}}</ref><ref name=music/><ref name=dizcanzone>{{cite book|last=Dario Salvatori|title=Dizionario delle canzoni italiane|publisher=Elle U|isbn=8888169016|page=215|chapter=Vita spericolata|year=2001}}</ref>  It has been described as a ""manifesto of human individualism taken to the extreme between transgression, boredom, melancholy and the determination to live without limits or schedules"".<ref name=music/> 

Cover versions of the song include those recorded by [[Francesco De Gregori]], [[Massimo Ranieri]] and [[Thelma Houston]] with an English-language version titled ""My Life Is Mine"".<ref name=""dizcanzone"" /> [[Gino Paoli]] reprised its refrain in his hit ""Quattro amici"".<ref name=music/><ref name=dizcanzone/>

== Article Draft ==
'''Jeremy Hammond''' (born January 8, 1985) is an American activist and former computer hacker from [[Chicago]]. He founded the computer security training website [[HackThisSite]] in 2003. He was first imprisoned over the [[Protest Warrior]] hack in 2005 and was later convicted of [[computer fraud]] in 2013 for [[2012–13 Stratfor email leak|hacking the private intelligence firm Stratfor]] and releasing data to [[WikiLeaks]], and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

In 2019, he was summoned before a Virginia [[federal grand jury]] which was investigating [[WikiLeaks]]<nowiki/>and its founder [[Julian Assange]]. He was held in [[Civil contempt|civil contempt of court]] after refusing to testify on the principle of grand jury resistance.

He was released from prison in November 2020.

== Early life ==
Hammond was raised in the [[Chicago]] suburb of [[Glendale Heights, Illinois]], with his twin brother Jason. Hammond became interested in computers at an early age, programming video games in [[QBasic]] by age eight, and building databases by age thirteen. As a student at [[Glenbard East High School]] in the nearby suburb of [[Lombard, Illinois|Lombard]], Hammond won first place in a district-wide science competition for a computer program he designed. While in [[high school]], he became a peace activist, organizing a student walkout on the day of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq invasion]] and starting a student newspaper to oppose the [[Iraq War]]. His high school principal described Hammond as ""old beyond his years"".

Hammond attended the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]. In the spring of 2004, during his freshman year, he exploited a security flaw on the computer science department's website and went to department administrators, offering to help fix the security flaws on the site and looking to get a job. For inserting the [[Backdoor (computing)|backdoor]], Hammond was called before the department chair and ultimately banned from returning for his sophomore year.

Jeremy, along with his brother Jason, has had a lifelong interest in music, performing in numerous bands through the years. Before Jeremy's arrests, they were both actively performing in the Chicago [[ska]] band Dirty Surgeon Insurgency.

Hammond worked as a [[Apple certification programs|Mac technician]] in [[Villa Park, Illinois]]. He also worked as a web developer for Chicago-based Rome & Company. His boss at Rome & Company wrote in 2010 that Hammond is ""friendly, courteous and polite and while we suspect he has a low tolerance for corporate posturing, he has never demonstrated any contempt for business in the workplace"".

== Computer hacking and activism ==
Hammond founded the computer security training website HackThisSite at age 18, during the summer after his high school graduation. The website describes itself as ""a non-profit organization that strives to protect a good security culture and learning atmosphere"". In its first two years the site received 2.5 million hits and acquired 110,000 members and a volunteer staff of 34.

During the 2004 [[DEF CON]] event in [[Las Vegas]], Hammond delivered a talk that encouraged ""[[electronic civil disobedience]]"" as a means of protest against the [[2004 Republican National Convention]] and its supporters.

In February 2005, Hammond, with others, hacked the website of pro-war [[Counterprotest|counterprotesting]] group [[Protest Warrior]] and accessed thousands of credit card numbers, intending to use them to donate to left-wing groups. Although no charges were ever made against the cards, Hammond confessed and was sentenced to two years in federal prison for the crime. Freed after 18 months, Hammond was radicalized by the experience, although the terms of his probation prohibited him from associating with HackThisSite or anarchist groups for another three years.

=== Stratfor case ===
On March 5, 2012, Hammond was arrested by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) agents in the [[Bridgeport, Chicago|Bridgeport]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]] for his involvement in the [[2012–13 Stratfor email leak|December 2011 cyberattack on Stratfor]], a private intelligence firm. The intrusion compromised 60,000 credit card numbers, $700,000 in fraudulent charges, and involved the download of 5 million emails, some of which were subsequently published by [[WikiLeaks]]. The indictment was unsealed the following day in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Manhattan federal district court]]. He was one of six individuals from the United States, England and Ireland indicted. Hammond faced a total of nine charges, including conspiracy to commit computer hacking, and conspiracy to commit access device fraud [37, 33].

The FBI was led to Hammond through information given by computer hacker [[Hector Xavier Monsegur]] (""Sabu""), who became a government informant immediately after his arrest in early 2011, and subsequently pleaded guilty in August 2011 to twelve counts of hacking, fraud, and [[identity theft]]. Although Monsegur could have received a sentence of more than 20 years in prison, prosecutors asked that he be sentenced to time served, which was seven months in prison. Information from Monsegur helped lead the authorities to at least eight co-conspirators, including Hammond, and helped to disrupt at least 300 cyberattacks.

The case was prosecuted by the office of [[Preet Bharara]], the [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]]. Hammond was represented by [[Elizabeth Fink]].

Sabu was [[Pretrial detention|detained pending trial]]; in denying bail, Judge [[Loretta A. Preska]] described Hammond as ""a very substantial danger to the community.""In February 2013, the defense filed a motion asking presiding Judge Preska to recuse herself from the case on the basis that Preska's husband, Thomas Kavaler, had an email address released in the Stratfor disclosure and worked with Stratfor clients that were affected by the hack. Hammond's legal team argued that this created ""appearance of partiality too strong to be disregarded"". Preska denied the motion, claiming that the connections were inconsequential or unimportant.

In May 2013, Hammond pleaded guilty to one count of violating the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] (CFAA). Upon his guilty plea, Hammond issued a statement saying, ""I did work with [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] to hack Stratfor, among other websites"" and ""I did what I believe is right."" He maintained that he had no profit motive for the cyberattack. Hammond has insisted that he would not have carried out the breach of Stratfor's systems without the involvement of Sabu. Hammond was sentenced on November 15, 2013, to the maximum of ten years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. He described his prosecution and sentence as a ""vengeful, spiteful act."" On November 17, 2020, Hammond was released from the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Memphis|Memphis Federal Correctional Institution]] and was transferred to a recovery house to serve the rest of his sentence.

In October 2019, Hammond was summoned before a Virginia [[federal grand jury]] which was investigating [[WikiLeaks]] and its founder [[Julian Assange]]. He was held in [[Civil contempt|civil contempt of court]] by Judge [[Anthony Trenga]] after refusing to testify. Prosecutors granted Hammond [[immunity from prosecution]] based on any grand jury testimony, so Hammond could not refuse to testify on the ground of his [[right against self-incrimination]]. Like [[Chelsea Manning]] (who was also held in contempt for refusing to testify), Hammond said he was ideologically opposed to any grand jury probe which was not being conducted in ""good faith"" as the government already had the information it needed. In making his contempt ruling, Trenga stated that Hammond's arguments against testifying were ""self-serving assertions … without support."" Trenga ordered Hammond released in March 2020 after the conclusion of the grand jury, saying that prosecutors no longer required his testimony. Hammond was returned to federal prison to serve the balance of his 10 year sentence. Hammond may have received an early release in December 2019 had the grand jury not intervened. 

== Personal life ==
He frequently identifies as an [[anarchist]] and has a shoulder tattoo of the [[anarchy symbol]] with the words: ""Freedom, equality, anarchy."" Writing after his arrest, Hammond said, ""I have always made it clear that I am an [[anarchist-communist]] – as in I believe we need to abolish capitalism and the state in its entirety to realize a free, egalitarian society. I'm not into watering down or selling out the message or making it more marketable for the masses.""

Hammond has been involved in various political causes and movements throughout his life, including environmentalism, animal rights, and anti-capitalism. In addition to his hacking activities, he has participated in protests, direct action, and community organizing [32].

== Legacy and impact ==
Jeremy Hammond's actions, convictions, and imprisonment have made him a prominent figure in the world of hacktivism and cybersecurity. His work with Anonymous and his involvement in high-profile hacks like the Stratfor case has drawn attention to the potential power and influence of hacktivism as a form of protest and civil disobedience. Hammond's case has also raised questions about the ethics of hacking, the role of government informants like Sabu, and the potential for prosecutorial overreach in cases involving cybersecurity [36].

Supporters argue that Hammond's actions exposed important information about corporate and government surveillance, as well as highlighting the need for greater transparency and accountability. On the other hand, critics contend that his methods were illegal and potentially harmful to innocent individuals whose personal information was exposed in the hacks.

Since his release from prison, Hammond has continued to advocate for transparency, digital privacy, and civil liberties. His experiences have also inspired others in the hacktivist community to continue fighting for their causes and to use their technical skills for social and political change [34].

=== Documentary and Media Coverage ===
Jeremy Hammond's story has been the subject of significant media coverage and interest, particularly within the realms of cybersecurity, hacktivism, and digital rights activism. In 2014, a documentary titled ""The Hacker Wars"" was released, which explores the world of hacktivists and prominently features Hammond's story, along with the stories of other notable hacktivists such as Barrett Brown and Weev. The documentary delves into the motivations, ethics, and consequences of hacktivism, as well as the legal battles and controversies that have surrounded these individuals [34].

Hammond's actions and the Stratfor hack have also been covered by various news outlets, investigative reports, and academic studies. His case has been used to examine the larger implications of hacktivism on society, the role of technology in activism, and the balance between national security and individual privacy in the digital age.

While Hammond's story continues to generate debate and discussion, his case has undoubtedly left a lasting impact on the world of hacktivism and cybersecurity. As concerns about digital privacy, surveillance, and the role of technology in activism continue to evolve, the legacy of Hammond and his fellow hacktivists will remain an important part of the conversation surrounding these issues [36].

Two human polls and a committee's selections comprise the [[2023 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2023]] [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) football rankings, in addition to various publications' preseason polls. Unlike most sports, college football's governing body, the NCAA, does not bestow a [[national championship]] at the FBS level.<!--it does for FCS and lower levels--> Instead, that title is bestowed by one or more different polling agencies. There are two main weekly polls that begin in the preseason—the [[AP Poll]] and the [[Coaches Poll]]. One additional poll, the [[College Football Playoff]] (CFP) ranking, is usually released starting midway through the season. The CFP rankings determine who makes the four-team playoff that determines the College Football Playoff National Champion.

'''''Ocypode mortoni''''' is a small-sized species of [[Ocypode]] found in South [[China]] and southern [[Japan]]. It is closely related to ''O. stimpsoni'' which is also found in the same regions, but can be distinguished by the presence of styles on their eyestalks. They also share the same range with ''O. ceratophthalmus'' (which also possess styles), but ''O. mortoni'' have 35 to 71 striae on their stridulating ridges and their smaller claws have broadly rounded to flattened tips.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sakai |first=Katsushi |last2=Tuerkay |first2=Michael |date=2013 |title=Revision of the genus Ocypode with the description of a new genus, Hoplocypode (Crustacea: Decapoda: Brachyura) |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/249794 |journal=Memoirs of the Queensland Museum |volume=56 |issue=2 |pages=665–793 |issn=0079-8835}}</ref>
